# User Story: Patient Registration System

**Epic**: Healthcare Patient Management  
**Story ID**: US-HPS-001  
**Title**: Secure Patient Registration with HIPAA Compliance  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Story Points**: 8  

## User Story

**As a** healthcare administrator  
**I want to** register new patients with encrypted personal information storage  
**So that** we can maintain HIPAA-compliant patient records while enabling efficient patient care  

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Security and Compliance
- [ ] All personally identifiable information (PII) must be encrypted using Fernet (AES 128/256)
- [ ] Patient access must be logged for HIPAA compliance auditing
- [ ] System must generate unique patient ID and medical record number
- [ ] Patient data must be stored with proper access controls
- [ ] Encryption keys must be securely managed (not stored in code)

### ✅ Functional Requirements
- [ ] System must capture: name, date of birth, SSN, contact information
- [ ] System must validate required fields before registration
- [ ] System must prevent duplicate patient registration (SSN/DOB matching)
- [ ] System must assign unique medical record number (MRN-XXXXXXXX format)
- [ ] System must set initial patient status to "ACTIVE"

### ✅ Data Management
- [ ] Patient records must include emergency contact fields
- [ ] System must support allergy and medication tracking
- [ ] Patient data must include creation and last updated timestamps
- [ ] System must support patient status updates (active, inactive, discharged, emergency)
- [ ] System must maintain audit trail of all patient data changes

### ✅ Integration Requirements
- [ ] System must provide API for patient record retrieval
- [ ] System must support patient data export for transfers
- [ ] System must integrate with appointment scheduling system
- [ ] System must support real-time patient status updates
- [ ] System must provide search functionality by MRN and patient details

### ✅ Performance Requirements
- [ ] Patient registration must complete within 3 seconds
- [ ] System must support 100+ concurrent registrations
- [ ] Patient record retrieval must complete within 500ms
- [ ] System must maintain 99.9% availability
- [ ] Encryption/decryption operations must not impact user experience

## Definition of Done

### ✅ Implementation Complete
- [ ] Patient class with encrypted PII fields implemented
- [ ] Registration method with validation and encryption
- [ ] Patient retrieval with access logging
- [ ] Patient status update functionality
- [ ] Medical record number generation system

### ✅ Testing Complete
- [ ] Unit tests for patient registration (95%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Security tests for encryption/decryption
- [ ] Performance tests for registration speed
- [ ] HIPAA compliance validation tests

### ✅ Documentation Complete
- [ ] API documentation for patient registration endpoints
- [ ] User guide for patient registration workflow
- [ ] Security documentation for PII encryption
- [ ] HIPAA compliance documentation
- [ ] Database schema documentation

### ✅ Security and Compliance
- [ ] Security review of encryption implementation
- [ ] HIPAA compliance audit of data handling
- [ ] Penetration testing of patient registration
- [ ] Access control validation
- [ ] Audit logging verification

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Encryption Strategy
```python
# Use Fernet for symmetric encryption of PII
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

class Patient:
    def __init__(self, cipher_suite):
        self.cipher_suite = cipher_suite
        self.encrypted_name = self._encrypt_pii(name)
        self.encrypted_ssn = self._encrypt_pii(ssn)
    
    def _encrypt_pii(self, data):
        return self.cipher_suite.encrypt(data.encode()).decode()
```

### Medical Record Number Format
- **Format**: MRN-{8 random hex digits}
- **Example**: MRN-A1B2C3D4
- **Uniqueness**: Verified against existing records
- **Generation**: Using secrets.token_hex(8)

### Audit Logging
```python
# Log all patient data access
def _log_access(user_id, action, resource_type, resource_id):
    audit_log = AuditLog(
        user_id=user_id,
        action=action,
        resource_type=resource_type,
        resource_id=resource_id,
        timestamp=datetime.now()
    )
```

## Dependencies
- **US-HPS-002**: Patient Status Management (for status updates)
- **US-HPS-005**: Audit Logging System (for compliance tracking)
- **US-HPS-008**: Encryption Key Management (for secure key storage)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Encryption key compromise
  - **Mitigation**: Use environment variables for keys, implement key rotation
- **Risk**: Performance impact of encryption
  - **Mitigation**: Benchmark encryption operations, optimize if needed
- **Risk**: HIPAA compliance violation
  - **Mitigation**: Security review, compliance audit, penetration testing

## Success Metrics
- **Registration Time**: < 3 seconds average
- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Data Integrity**: 100% successful encryptions
- **Compliance Score**: 100% HIPAA compliance audit
- **User Satisfaction**: 95%+ user acceptance rating
