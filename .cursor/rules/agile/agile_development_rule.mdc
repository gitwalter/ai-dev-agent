## Core Requirements

### 1. Crystal Transparency Principle
**CRITICAL**: All development work must be completely transparent and visible to all stakeholders
```yaml
# REQUIRED: Crystal transparency in all work
crystal_transparency_requirements:
  - "All work progress visible in real-time"
  - "All decisions and rationale documented"
  - "All blockers and impediments immediately visible"
  - "All quality metrics and test results transparent"
  - "All code changes and commits tracked"
  - "All user story status updates immediate"
  - "All sprint progress visible to entire team"
  - "All technical debt and issues openly tracked"
  - "All performance metrics and analytics shared"
  - "All learning and improvement opportunities documented"
```

### 2. Agile Artifact Maintenance
**MANDATORY**: All agile artifacts must be kept current and accurate
```yaml
# REQUIRED: Update agile artifacts immediately with any changes
agile_artifacts_maintenance:
  - "Product backlog updated with current status"
  - "Sprint backlog reflects actual progress"
  - "User story status tracked accurately"
  - "Definition of done enforced for all work"
  - "Velocity and burndown charts current"
```

### 3. Crystal Transparency Implementation
**MANDATORY**: Implement crystal transparency in all development activities
```python
# CORRECT: Crystal transparent development
def implement_crystal_transparency():
    """Implement crystal transparency in all development work."""
    
    # Real-time progress visibility
    update_progress_immediately = True
    share_all_metrics = True
    document_all_decisions = True
    
    # Immediate blocker visibility
    def report_blocker_immediately(blocker: str, impact: str):
        """Report blocker immediately with full transparency."""
        update_agile_artifacts(blocker=blocker, impact=impact)
        notify_all_stakeholders(blocker, impact)
        document_blocker_rationale(blocker, impact)
    
    # Transparent decision making
    def document_decision_rationale(decision: str, alternatives: list, rationale: str):
        """Document decision with full transparency."""
        update_decision_log(decision, alternatives, rationale)
        share_with_team(decision, rationale)
        update_agile_artifacts(decision=decision, rationale=rationale)
    
    # Quality transparency
    def share_quality_metrics_immediately(metrics: dict):
        """Share all quality metrics immediately."""
        update_quality_dashboard(metrics)
        notify_team_of_quality_status(metrics)
        document_quality_trends(metrics)

# INCORRECT: Non-transparent development
def implement_without_transparency(feature: str):
    """Implement feature without crystal transparency."""
    # This violates crystal transparency principle
    pass
```

### 4. User Story Tracking
**MANDATORY**: All work must be tied to user stories with proper status tracking
```python
# CORRECT: Proper user story tracking
def update_user_story_status(story_id: str, status: str, progress: dict):
    """Update user story with current status and progress."""
    # Update product backlog
    update_product_backlog(story_id, status, progress)
    
    # Update sprint backlog if in current sprint
    if is_in_current_sprint(story_id):
        update_sprint_backlog(story_id, status, progress)
    
    # Update acceptance criteria completion
    update_acceptance_criteria(story_id, progress["completed_criteria"])
    
    # Update definition of done validation
    validate_definition_of_done(story_id)

# INCORRECT: Work without user story tracking
def implement_feature_without_tracking(feature: str):
    """Implement feature without proper agile tracking."""
    # This violates agile principles
    pass
```

### 5. Sprint Goal Alignment
**MANDATORY**: All work must align with current sprint goals
```python
# CORRECT: Sprint-aligned development
def validate_sprint_alignment(task: str, sprint_goal: str) -> bool:
    """Validate task aligns with current sprint goal."""
    task_value = analyze_task_value(task)
    sprint_value = analyze_sprint_goal_value(sprint_goal)
    
    return task_value.aligns_with(sprint_value)

# INCORRECT: Sprint goal violation
def implement_non_sprint_task(task: str):
    """Implement task not aligned with sprint goal."""
    # This violates sprint focus
    pass
```

### 6. Definition of Done Enforcement
**MANDATORY**: All work must meet definition of done criteria
```python
# CORRECT: Definition of done validation
def validate_definition_of_done(work_item: WorkItem) -> bool:
    """Validate work item meets definition of done."""
    criteria = [
        "All acceptance criteria met",
        "Code reviewed and approved",
        "Tests written and passing",
        "Documentation updated",
        "Deployment ready",
        "User story status updated"
    ]
    
    return all(validate_criterion(work_item, criterion) for criterion in criteria)

# INCORRECT: Incomplete work completion
def mark_incomplete_work_as_done(work_item: WorkItem):
    """Mark work as done without meeting criteria."""
    # This violates definition of done
    pass
```

        self.status = "To Do"
        self.progress = {}
        self.blockers = []
        self.acceptance_criteria = []
        self.completed_criteria = []
    
    def update_status(self, new_status: str, progress: dict = None):

        # Update agile artifacts
        self._update_agile_artifacts()
    
    def _update_agile_artifacts(self):
        """Update all agile artifacts with current status."""
        update_product_backlog(self.story_id, self.status, self.progress)
        update_sprint_backlog(self.story_id, self.status, self.progress)

```

### 4. Sprint Goal Validation
```python
# MANDATORY: Validate sprint goal alignment
def validate_sprint_alignment_for_task(task: str) -> bool:
    """Validate task aligns with current sprint goal."""
    
    # Get current sprint goal
    sprint_goal = get_current_sprint_goal()
    
    # Analyze task value and alignment
    task_analysis = analyze_task_value(task)
    goal_analysis = analyze_sprint_goal(sprint_goal)
    
    # Check alignment
    alignment_score = calculate_alignment_score(task_analysis, goal_analysis)
    
    if alignment_score < 0.7:  # 70% alignment threshold
        raise SprintAlignmentError(f"Task '{task}' does not align with sprint goal: {sprint_goal}")
    
    return True
```

## Sprint Document Organization Requirements
