- New requirements that significantly impact architecture

**REQUIRED PROCESS FOR MODIFICATIONS**:
1. **Document the Issue**: Create detailed analysis of why modification is needed
2. **Assess Impact**: Evaluate impact on overall system stability and goals
3. **Propose Solution**: Provide alternative approach that maintains system goals
4. **Update Plans**: Modify the relevant plan document with clear rationale
5. **Validate Changes**: Ensure modifications don't compromise system stability
6. **Communicate Changes**: Update team and stakeholders about modifications

### Modification Constraints
**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS**:
- **NEVER** compromise the goal of creating a stable multi-agent system
- **NEVER** remove established framework usage (LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith)
- **NEVER** reduce test coverage below 90% for core components
