# Context Awareness and Documentation Excellence Rule

**CRITICAL**: Always read and understand the context, README files, and relevant documentation before working in any folder, directory, or codebase area. Context awareness is the foundation of excellence.

## Description
This rule enforces systematic context gathering and documentation review before beginning any work in a folder or codebase area. It complements the Document Excellence Rule by ensuring that all work is informed by existing context, standards, and requirements.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Pre-Work Context Assessment
**MANDATORY**: Before starting any work in a folder, complete this context assessment
```bash
# REQUIRED CONTEXT ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST:
# 1. Read README.md (if present)
# 2. Review any CONTEXT.md or documentation files
# 3. Check for configuration files (.env, config.*, etc.)
# 4. Examine existing code structure and patterns
# 5. Review any test files for expected behavior
# 6. Check for package.json, requirements.txt, or dependency files
# 7. Look for existing documentation or comments
# 8. Understand the folder's purpose and role in the project
```

### 2. Documentation Reading Hierarchy
**MANDATORY**: Follow this reading order for comprehensive context understanding
```yaml
reading_priority:
  critical_files:
    1: "README.md"           # Primary project/folder documentation
    2: "CONTEXT.md"          # Specific context information
    3: "GETTING_STARTED.md"  # Setup and usage instructions
    4: "ARCHITECTURE.md"     # Technical architecture details
    5: "CHANGELOG.md"        # Recent changes and evolution
  
  configuration_files:
    1: ".env.example"        # Environment configuration examples
    2: "config.*"            # Configuration file patterns
    3: "package.json"        # Node.js dependencies and scripts
    4: "requirements.txt"    # Python dependencies
    5: "Dockerfile"          # Container configuration
    6: "docker-compose.yml"  # Multi-container setup
  
  code_understanding:
    1: "__init__.py"         # Python package initialization
    2: "main.py" / "app.py"  # Primary application entry points
    3: "index.js" / "index.ts" # JavaScript/TypeScript entry points
    4: "tests/"              # Test files for expected behavior
    5: "examples/"           # Usage examples and patterns
```

### 3. Context Documentation Standards
**MANDATORY**: Document context understanding before proceeding
```python
# REQUIRED: Context Documentation Template
def document_context_understanding(folder_path: str) -> ContextAssessment:
    """
    Document understanding of folder context before beginning work.
    
    Args:
        folder_path: Path to the folder being worked on
        
    Returns:
        ContextAssessment with comprehensive understanding
    """
    assessment = ContextAssessment(
        folder_path=folder_path,
        primary_purpose="",           # What this folder/module does
        key_dependencies=[],          # Critical dependencies identified
        existing_patterns=[],         # Code patterns and conventions found
        configuration_requirements=[], # Configuration needs discovered
        testing_approach="",          # Testing strategy observed
        documentation_quality="",     # Quality of existing documentation
        integration_points=[],        # How this integrates with other parts
