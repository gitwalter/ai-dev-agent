# Cursor Project Rules - Optimized and Standardized

This directory contains all cursor project rules that have been optimized for better usage and standardized naming conventions.

## Rule Categories and Standards

All rules follow the standardized naming convention: `category_action_rule.mdc`

### Metadata Structure
Each rule includes standardized metadata:
```yaml
---
description: "Clear, specific description of the rule's purpose and scope"
category: "Primary category (testing, security, project-management, etc.)"
priority: "critical, high, medium, low"
alwaysApply: "true/false"
globs: ["file patterns this rule applies to"]
tags: ["relevant tags for categorization"]
---
```
