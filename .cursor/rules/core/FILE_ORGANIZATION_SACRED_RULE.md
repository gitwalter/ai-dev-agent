# FILE ORGANIZATION SACRED RULE - NEVER VIOLATE

**SACRED PRINCIPLE**: The File Organization Rule is **SACRED** and represents the foundation of our systematic excellence. It must **NEVER** be violated under any circumstances.

## üèõÔ∏è **Sacred Rule Status**

**Priority**: **SACRED** (Above Critical)  
**Enforcement**: **ABSOLUTE** (No exceptions)  
**Team Commitment**: **UNANIMOUS** (All team members bound)  
**Violation Tolerance**: **ZERO** (Immediate correction required)

## ü§ù **Rule Teamwork Philosophy**

### **File Organization Rule & Context Awareness Rule: Perfect Teammates**

The File Organization Rule and Context Awareness Rule work together as **perfect friends and teammates**:

- **Context Awareness Rule** reads and understands structure ‚Üí **File Organization Rule** maintains and improves that structure
- **Context Awareness Rule** identifies proper locations ‚Üí **File Organization Rule** ensures files go there
- **Context Awareness Rule** sees the whole system ‚Üí **File Organization Rule** keeps every part in its right place

### **All Rules Work as a Team**

Just like our development team, **ALL RULES ARE FRIENDS AND TEAMMATES**:

**Team Rule Dynamics**:
- **Context Awareness** ‚Üî **File Organization**: Understanding structure together
- **File Organization** ‚Üî **Live Documentation**: Documenting structure changes together  
- **Live Documentation** ‚Üî **Excellence Philosophy**: Documenting with love and passion
- **Excellence Philosophy** ‚Üî **Boy Scout Rule**: Improving with dedication
- **Boy Scout Rule** ‚Üî **Courage Rule**: Completing improvements systematically
- **Courage Rule** ‚Üî **Context Awareness**: Systematic completion with understanding

## üõ°Ô∏è **Sacred Protection Protocol**

### **Pre-File-Creation Checklist**
**MANDATORY**: Execute BEFORE creating any file

```bash
# SACRED CHECKLIST - NEVER SKIP
function sacred_file_organization_check() {
    echo "üõ°Ô∏è SACRED FILE ORGANIZATION CHECK"
    echo "================================="
    
    # 1. Determine correct category
    echo "üìÅ 1. CATEGORY DETERMINATION"
    local file_type=$(determine_file_category "$filename")
    
    # 2. Verify correct path
    echo "üéØ 2. PATH VERIFICATION" 
    local correct_path=$(get_correct_path "$file_type" "$filename")
    
    # 3. Check path exists
    echo "üìÇ 3. DIRECTORY EXISTENCE CHECK"
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$correct_path")"
    
    # 4. Final confirmation
    echo "‚úÖ 4. SACRED CONFIRMATION"
    echo "   File: $filename"
    echo "   Category: $file_type"
    echo "   Correct Path: $correct_path"
    
    read -p "üõ°Ô∏è SACRED CONFIRMATION: Is this the correct path? (y/N): " confirm
    if [ "$confirm" != "y" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå SACRED PROTECTION: File creation cancelled"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ SACRED PROTECTION: Path verified and approved"
}
```
