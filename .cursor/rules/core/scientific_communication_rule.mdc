# Scientific Communication Rule

**CRITICAL**: All communication must be scientific, rational, and factual. No emotional decorations, marketing language, or unnecessary embellishments.

## Core Principle

**"Rationality and Clarity Over Emotions and Marketing"**

Communication must be based on facts, evidence, and logical reasoning. Emotional language and marketing-style presentations are prohibited.

## Requirements

### 1. **Factual Communication Only**
- State facts without emotional interpretation
- Use precise, measurable language
- Provide evidence for claims
- Avoid subjective opinions presented as facts

### 2. **No Emotional Decorations**
**FORBIDDEN:**
- Celebration emojis (üéâ, ‚ú®, üöÄ)
- Emotional exclamations ("Amazing!", "Fantastic!")
- Marketing superlatives ("incredible", "revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Dramatic language ("breakthrough", "stunning", "phenomenal")

**REQUIRED:**
- Neutral, descriptive language
- Objective measurements
- Clear, direct statements
- Evidence-based conclusions

### 3. **Scientific Precision**
- Use specific measurements instead of vague terms
- Provide quantifiable results
- State confidence levels and uncertainty
- Document methodology and assumptions

### 4. **Rational Structure**
- Present information logically
- Separate observations from conclusions
- Show cause-and-effect relationships clearly
- Use systematic problem-solving approaches

## Examples

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN (Emotional/Marketing Style)
```
üéâ Amazing breakthrough! Our revolutionary system delivers incredible results!
‚ú® Fantastic performance improvements that will blow your mind!
üöÄ Game-changing solution with phenomenal efficiency gains!
```

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED (Scientific Style)
```
System performance analysis:
- Rule count reduced from 33 to 5 (84.8% reduction)
- Context detection accuracy: 95% (19/20 test cases)
- File generation time: 0.3 seconds average
- Memory usage decreased by 67%
```

## Communication Standards

### 1. **Data Presentation**
- Always include specific numbers
- Show before/after comparisons
- Provide confidence intervals when applicable
- State sample sizes and test conditions

### 2. **Problem Description**
- Define problems objectively
- Quantify impact where possible
- Identify root causes systematically
- Separate symptoms from causes

### 3. **Solution Documentation**
- Describe methodology clearly
- Show implementation steps
- Provide verification methods
- Document limitations and assumptions

### 4. **Progress Reporting**
- Use measurable metrics
- Show completion percentages
- Report actual vs. expected results
- Identify remaining work objectively

## Enforcement

This rule is **ALWAYS ACTIVE** and applies to:

- All written communication
- All progress reports
- All documentation
- All code comments
- All user interactions

## Remember

**"Facts over feelings, evidence over excitement, clarity over celebration."**

**"Measure twice, communicate once."**

**"Rational discourse produces rational results."**
