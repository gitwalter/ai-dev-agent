# Cursor Project Rules - Organized and Categorized

This directory contains all cursor project rules organized into logical categories for better discoverability and management.

## New Organization Structure

Rules are now organized into logical categories with clear folder structure:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── core/                   # Critical rules that always apply (6 rules)
├── development/            # Core development practices (6 rules)
├── agile/                  # Agile methodology rules (6 rules)
├── testing/                # Testing and QA rules (2 rules)
├── security/               # Security standards (2 rules)
├── quality/                # Quality assurance (4 rules)
├── automation/             # Automation tools (3 rules)
├── infrastructure/         # System configuration (3 rules)
├── workflow/               # Session management (3 rules)
├── meta/                   # Rule governance (6 rules)
└── docs/                   # Documentation
    ├── README.md           # This file
    ├── index.md            # Complete rule index
    ├── RULE_APPLICATION_GUIDE.md
    └── RULE_DOCUMENT_EXCELLENCE.md
```

All rules follow the standardized naming convention: `category_action_rule.mdc`

### Critical Rules Framework Integration
**NEW**: Critical rules are now automatically applied through the Core Rule Application Framework:
- **Courage Rule**: Always active in every work session
- **No Premature Victory Declaration Rule**: Always active in every progress report and communication
- **No Failing Tests Rule**: Always active in every development session
- **Boy Scout Rule**: Always active in every code modification

### Metadata Structure
Each rule includes standardized metadata:
```yaml
---
description: "Clear, specific description of the rule's purpose and scope"
category: "Primary category (testing, security, project-management, etc.)"
priority: "critical, high, medium, low"
alwaysApply: "true/false"
globs: ["file patterns this rule applies to"]
tags: ["relevant tags for categorization"]
---
```
