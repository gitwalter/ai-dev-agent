# Active Knowledge Extension and Research Rule

**CRITICAL**: When encountering any topic, technology, pattern, or domain concept that requires deeper understanding to solve a task optimally, proactively search project documentation first, then web resources, to gain comprehensive knowledge before proceeding.

## Description
This rule enforces proactive knowledge gathering and research to ensure all development decisions are informed by comprehensive understanding. It prevents assumptions, reduces errors, and enables optimal solutions through systematic knowledge acquisition.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Knowledge Gap Recognition
**MANDATORY**: Actively identify when additional knowledge would improve task solutions
```yaml
knowledge_gap_triggers:
  - "Unfamiliar technology or framework mentioned"
  - "Complex domain concepts encountered" 
  - "Best practices uncertainty for specific scenarios"
  - "Performance optimization opportunities unclear"
  - "Security implications not fully understood"
  - "Integration patterns need clarification"
  - "Error handling approaches need validation"
  - "Design pattern selection requires research"
```

### 2. Systematic Knowledge Search Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Follow this search sequence when knowledge gaps identified

#### **Step 1: Project Documentation Search**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Search project docs first
1. Search project README and documentation files
2. Check docs/ folder for relevant guides
3. Review agile artifacts for related requirements
4. Examine existing code for patterns and approaches
5. Check test files for expected behaviors and examples
6. Review configuration files for setup patterns
7. Search commit history for related implementation decisions
```

#### **Step 2: Codebase Pattern Analysis**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Analyze existing codebase patterns
1. Search for similar implementations in the codebase
2. Examine existing patterns and architectural decisions
3. Review error handling approaches used
4. Study performance optimization techniques applied
5. Analyze testing strategies and validation methods
6. Check security implementation patterns
7. Review integration approaches used
```

#### **Step 3: Web Research (When Project Knowledge Insufficient)**
```bash
# REQUIRED: Systematic web research when needed
1. Search for official documentation of technologies/frameworks
2. Research best practices from authoritative sources
3. Look for performance benchmarks and optimization guides
4. Find security guidelines and vulnerability information
5. Research design patterns and architectural approaches
6. Check for recent updates, changes, or deprecations
7. Validate approaches with community recommendations
```

### 3. Knowledge Application Requirements
**MANDATORY**: Apply acquired knowledge systematically

#### **Knowledge Integration**
```python
def apply_researched_knowledge(task_context: Dict[str, Any], 
                             research_findings: List[KnowledgeItem]) -> OptimizedApproach:
    """
    Integrate researched knowledge into task approach.
    
    Args:
        task_context: Current task context and requirements
        research_findings: Knowledge items discovered through research
        
    Returns:
        Optimized approach incorporating best practices and knowledge
    """
    # Validate knowledge relevance
    relevant_knowledge = filter_relevant_knowledge(research_findings, task_context)
    
    # Apply best practices discovered
    optimized_approach = integrate_best_practices(task_context, relevant_knowledge)
    
    # Validate against project standards
    validated_approach = validate_against_project_standards(optimized_approach)
    
    return validated_approach
```

#### **Knowledge Documentation**
```python
def document_research_findings(research_session: ResearchSession) -> None:
    """
    Document research findings for future reference.
    
    Args:
        research_session: Completed research session with findings
    """
    # Create knowledge document
    knowledge_doc = create_knowledge_document(research_session)
    
    # Store in project knowledge base
    store_in_knowledge_base(knowledge_doc)
    
    # Update relevant documentation
    update_project_documentation(knowledge_doc)
    
    # Share with team if valuable
