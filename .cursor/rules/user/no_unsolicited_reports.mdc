# No Unsolicited Reports Rule

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT create summary reports, status documents, completion reports, migration summaries, or analysis documents unless the user EXPLICITLY requests them.

## Core Principle

**"Implementation First, Reports Only When Asked"**

Users want **working code and systems**, not meta-documentation about what you did. Focus on implementation work, not self-reporting.

## What NOT to Create (Unless Asked)

❌ **Forbidden Without Explicit Request**:
- Migration completion reports
- Status summaries  
- Work completion documents
- Implementation analysis documents
- "What we accomplished" summaries
- "Next steps" planning documents
- Progress reports
- Achievement summaries
- Any document that describes work done rather than technical documentation

## What TO Create (Without Being Asked)

✅ **Always Create**:
- Code files
- Configuration files
- Technical documentation (README.md, API docs)
- Inline code comments
- Error handling
- Tests

✅ **Create When Stale**:
- README.md updates when features change
- API documentation when interfaces change
- Architecture docs when design changes
- Integration guides when dependencies change

## User Phrases That Mean "Create a Report"

Only create reports when user says:
- "create a report"
- "write a summary"
- "document what you did"
- "summarize the work"
- "create a migration report"
- "write up the results"

## Examples

### ❌ WRONG (Unsolicited Report)

```markdown
# LangSmith Migration Complete

## Summary
Successfully migrated all prompts to LangSmith...

## What Was Accomplished
- ✅ Migrated 8 prompts
- ✅ Created hybrid system
...
```

**Why Wrong**: User didn't ask for a summary. Just do the work and stop.

### ✅ CORRECT (Just Do the Work)

```
[Migrates prompts]
[Updates code]
[Tests system]

User: "Looks good!"
```

**Why Correct**: Work is done, system works. No unsolicited report needed.

### ✅ CORRECT (When User Asks)

User: "Can you summarize what you just did?"

```markdown
# Migration Summary

Migrated 8 prompts to LangSmith...
```

**Why Correct**: User explicitly requested a summary.

## Enforcement

**Before creating ANY document**, ask:
1. Is this technical documentation needed for the system to work?
2. Did the user explicitly ask for this report/summary?

If both answers are NO → **Don't create it!**

## Remember

**"Users want action, not reports about action."**

**"Show, don't tell."**

**"Code speaks louder than status documents."**
