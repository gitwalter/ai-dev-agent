"""
Sacred Purpose Rule Enforcer
===========================

FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH: Rules are sacred tools that must serve higher purpose excellently.
Any rule that fails to serve its higher purpose is a VIOLATION, not a guideline.

Core Sacred Principles:
1. Every rule serves a divine higher purpose
2. Excellence in service is mandatory, not optional
3. Rules that don't serve excellently are violations
4. Purpose alignment is continuously validated
5. Sacred trust requires perfect service

Philosophy: "A rule without higher purpose is not a rule - it is noise.
A rule that serves poorly is not just ineffective - it is a violation of sacred trust."

Divine Higher Purposes:
- SAFETY: Protect all beings from harm
- EXCELLENCE: Enable the highest quality in all work
- HARMONY: Create smooth, effortless collaboration
- GROWTH: Facilitate learning and improvement
- SERVICE: Serve the greater good of all users
- WISDOM: Accumulate and apply knowledge effectively
