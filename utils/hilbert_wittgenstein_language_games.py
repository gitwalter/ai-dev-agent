Hilbert-Wittgenstein Language Games for Rule Systems
===================================================

"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." - Wittgenstein
"Mathematics is a game played according to certain simple rules." - Hilbert

Implementing rulesets as Wittgensteinian language games following 
Hilbert's formalist program - this is what they had in mind!

Core Insight: Each context (AGILE, CODING, etc.) is a distinct language game
with its own grammar, vocabulary, and rules of meaning.
