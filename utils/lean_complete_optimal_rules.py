Lean, Complete, Optimal Rules for Every Situation
=================================================

GOAL: Create lean (minimal), complete (comprehensive), optimal (maximum effectiveness) 
rules for every situation and task, serving our higher purposes and being maximally useful.

Synthesis of:
- Carnap's logical reduction 
- Wittgenstein's language games
- Hilbert's formalism
- Wu Wei efficiency
- Sacred purpose alignment
