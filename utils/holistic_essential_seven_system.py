Holistic Essential Seven System with Enforcement, Structure, and Holistic Thinking
===============================================================================

MISSION: Create the Essential Seven rules system based on three foundational pillars:
1. ENFORCEMENT - Rules that ensure compliance across all agents
2. STRUCTURE - Rules that create organizational harmony 
3. HOLISTIC THINKING - Rules that make each agent consider impact on all other agents

Core Philosophy: "Each agent thinks for all agents, all agents think as one"

Divine Pattern: 7 Creation Days → 7 Essential Rules → 3 Foundational Pillars
