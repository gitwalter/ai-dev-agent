Organic Continuous Self-Optimization System
===========================================

FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE: "Since we are growing organic, continuous self-optimization is key"

This system implements organic, living self-optimization that grows naturally like a biological organism:
- Cells (files) in correct locations for healthy function
- Organic growth patterns that adapt and evolve
- Continuous optimization as a living, breathing process
- Self-healing mechanisms like biological immune systems
- Metabolic optimization for maximum efficiency and health

Biological Metaphors:
- CELLS = Files in correct directories (healthy cellular structure)
- ORGANS = Functional modules working in harmony
- METABOLISM = Continuous processing and optimization
- IMMUNE SYSTEM = Error detection and correction
- GROWTH = Adaptive evolution and learning
- HOMEOSTASIS = System balance and stability

"Misplaced files are like dysfunctional cells - they disrupt the entire organism's health"
