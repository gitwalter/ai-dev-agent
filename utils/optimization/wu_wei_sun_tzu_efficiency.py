Wu Wei + Sun Tzu Efficiency System
==================================

SACRED MISSION: Maximum impact through minimum effort, serving the highest good of all.

Core Principles Integration:
- Wu Wei (無為): Effortless action in harmony with natural flow
- Sun Tzu: Strategic efficiency and winning without fighting
- Universal Benefit: Every optimization serves ALL beings

Philosophy: "The wise leader accomplishes without striving, teaches without words, 
and benefits all without competing."

Strategic Implementation: "Know yourself, know your task, and know your tools. 
In a hundred development sessions, you will never be in peril."
