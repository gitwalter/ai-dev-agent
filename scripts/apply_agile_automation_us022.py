Apply Agile Automation to US-022 Health Dashboard Fix.

This script demonstrates applying the agile automation system to the 
existing US-022 health dashboard NumPy compatibility fix, showing how
the automation integrates with existing work.

This is a practical example of:
1. Retroactively applying automation to existing stories
2. Updating all agile artifacts automatically
3. Integrating with current sprint work
4. Maintaining progress tracking

The health dashboard fails to load due to NumPy 2.0 compatibility issues.
The error occurs in the dependency chain: health_dashboard.py ‚Üí plotly.express ‚Üí xarray ‚Üí dask ‚Üí np.round_ (deprecated).

Technical Details:
- Error: AttributeError: `np.round_` was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release
- Location: dask.array.routines line 1552
- Impact: Complete health dashboard failure
- Affected File: utils/health_dashboard.py

This critical issue prevents:
- System health monitoring dashboard access  
- Agent status visualization and tracking
- Performance metrics display and analysis
- Real-time system health monitoring
- US-001 System Health Monitoring completion

Root Cause Analysis:
- NumPy 2.0 removed deprecated np.round_ function
- Dask library still references deprecated function
- Plotly depends on xarray which depends on dask
- Health dashboard imports plotly for visualizations

Solution Options:
1. Update dask to NumPy 2.0 compatible version
2. Pin NumPy to 1.x until dependencies are compatible
3. Replace plotly with alternative visualization library
4. Use conda environment with compatible versions

CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTORATION: The health dashboard is essential operational infrastructure that provides:

**Immediate Business Impact:**
- System health is completely invisible to development team
- Cannot monitor agent performance or system status
- Proactive issue detection is disabled
- US-001 (System Health Monitoring) is completely blocked
- Development productivity is significantly reduced
- System reliability monitoring is non-functional

**Operational Consequences:**
- No visibility into system health during development
- Cannot detect performance degradation or failures
- Manual system monitoring required (inefficient)
- Risk of undetected system issues accumulating
- Team confidence in system stability reduced

**Strategic Impact:**
- Blocks completion of Sprint 1 foundation goals
- Prevents operational excellence initiatives
- Reduces team ability to maintain system quality
- Impacts stakeholder confidence in system reliability

**Resolution Benefits:**
- Immediate restoration of critical monitoring capabilities
- Enables completion of US-001 health monitoring system
- Restores team visibility into system health
- Supports proactive issue identification and resolution
- Unblocks foundation infrastructure development
