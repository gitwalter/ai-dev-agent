# Unified Context-Aware Agent System

**REVOLUTIONARY**: Complete integration of all agent contexts (@code, @debug, @test, @docs, @architecture, @security, @agile) with Foundation-Practical Onion Architecture values and intelligent rule optimization.

## System Overview

This system actualizes our vision of **context-aware intelligence** where each agent type operates with optimal efficiency by applying exactly the right rules for the right context at the right time.

### **Foundation-Practical Integration**

All agent contexts are built upon our **8-layer Foundation-Practical Onion Architecture**:
- **Foundation Layers**: Universal principles that guide ALL agents
- **Practical Layers**: Specialized engineering excellence per agent type

## Context Coordination System

### **Multi-Context Operations**
When multiple contexts are specified (e.g., `@code @test @agile`), the system coordinates optimally:

```yaml
coordination_strategy:
  primary_context: "First mentioned context takes priority"
  rule_intersection: "Apply rules common to all contexts"
  conflict_resolution: "Primary context rules override secondary"
  efficiency_optimization: "Minimize rule overhead while maintaining quality"

example_coordination:
  "@code @test":
    primary: "code"
    shared_rules: [TDD, clean_code, safety_first]
    code_specific: [design_patterns, refactoring]
    test_specific: [test_quality, coverage_requirements]
    excluded: [agile_artifacts, extensive_documentation]
```

### **Context Switching Protocol**
```yaml
context_switching:
  automatic_detection: "Based on user query patterns and file context"
  explicit_override: "@keyword takes immediate precedence"
  smooth_transition: "Maintain context continuity during long sessions"
  memory_persistence: "Remember effective context patterns for user"
```

## Foundation-Practical Integration

### **Universal Foundation (Layer 0) - ALL Agents**
```yaml

### **Practical Layer Specialization Per Agent**

Each agent type specializes the 6 practical layers according to its domain:

```yaml

  code_agent:
    software_architecture: "Design patterns, SOLID, clean architecture"
    development_implementation: "TDD, clean code, refactoring"
    # ... other layers adapted for coding

    # ... other layers adapted for debugging

  test_agent:
    software_architecture: "Test architecture, test patterns"
    development_implementation: "Test-driven development, test automation"
    # ... other layers adapted for testing
```

## Performance Optimization

### **Context-Based Performance Targets**
```yaml
performance_targets:
  small_context: "<50ms response time, 90% rule reduction"
  medium_context: "<200ms response time, 60% rule reduction"
  large_context: "<500ms response time, 20% rule reduction"
  
efficiency_metrics:
  rule_application_time: "Measure time spent on rule processing"

## Enforcement

This system is **FOUNDATIONAL** and applies to ALL development work.

**Context-aware optimization enhances rather than replaces our Foundation-Practical excellence standards.**

## Remember

**"Right agent, right context, right time, maximum efficiency."**

**"Context intelligence amplifies rather than compromises our foundational values."**

**"Every agent carries the same divine, scientific, and ethical DNA while specializing in their domain."**
