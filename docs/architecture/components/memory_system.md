# Memory System Architecture

## Overview

The memory system provides persistent, semantic memory capabilities for our multi-agent system, enabling agents to learn from past interactions and maintain context across sessions.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Vector Store Layer
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Core memory storage
recall_vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

**Purpose**: Semantic storage and retrieval of memories using vector embeddings
**Features**:
- Semantic similarity search
- User isolation and filtering
- Metadata storage for structured information
- Scalable memory storage

### 2. Memory Tools Layer
```python
@tool
def save_recall_memory(memories: List[KnowledgeTriple], config: RunnableConfig) -> str:
    """Save memory to vectorstore for later semantic retrieval."""

@tool
def search_recall_memories(query: str, config: RunnableConfig) -> List[str]:
    """Search for relevant memories in the vectorstore."""
```

**Purpose**: Provide standardized interfaces for memory operations
**Features**:
- Structured memory saving
- Context-aware memory retrieval
- User-specific memory isolation
- Integration with LangGraph workflows

### 3. Knowledge Triple Structure
```python
class KnowledgeTriple(TypedDict):
    subject: str
    predicate: str
    object_: str
```

**Purpose**: Structured representation of knowledge for semantic storage
**Features**:
- Subject-predicate-object relationships
- Graph-like knowledge representation
- Queryable knowledge structure
- Extensible metadata support

### 4. Memory Context Layer
```python
def create_memory_context(recall_memories: list, chat_history: list) -> str:
    """Create context from memories and chat history."""
```

**Purpose**: Synthesize memory context for agent enhancement
**Features**:
- Memory relevance scoring
- Context synthesis
- History integration
- Adaptive context creation

## System Design

### Memory Flow
```
User Input → Context Extraction → Memory Search → Memory Context → Agent Enhancement
     ↓
Memory Generation → Knowledge Extraction → Memory Storage → Vector Store
```

### Data Flow
1. **Input Processing**: Extract context from user input and current state
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Search vector store for relevant memories
3. **Context Creation**: Synthesize memory context with current conversation
4. **Agent Enhancement**: Provide memory context to agents
5. **Memory Generation**: Extract new knowledge from agent responses
6. **Memory Storage**: Store new memories in vector store

### User Isolation
```python
def get_user_id(config: RunnableConfig) -> str:
    """Extract user ID from configuration."""
    return config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id", "default_user")
```

**Features**:
- User-specific memory filtering
- Privacy and data isolation
- Multi-tenant support
- Configurable user identification

## Integration Points

### 1. LangGraph Integration
```python
def load_memories(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig) -> AgentState:
    """Load relevant memories based on current context."""
```

**Integration**:
- Memory loading as workflow node
- State enhancement with memory context
- Memory-aware agent execution
- Persistent memory across sessions

### 2. Agent Integration
```python
def memory_enhanced_agent(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig) -> AgentState:
    """Agent function with long-term memory integration."""
```

**Integration**:
- Memory context in agent prompts
- Automatic memory extraction
- Memory-aware responses
- Learning from interactions

### 3. Workflow Integration
```python
def create_memory_enhanced_workflow():
    """Create a workflow with long-term memory capabilities."""
```

**Integration**:
- Memory loading in workflow execution
- Memory persistence across workflow steps
- Memory sharing between agents
- Memory-based quality assessment

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Retrieval Optimization
- **Semantic Search**: Use vector similarity for relevant memory retrieval
