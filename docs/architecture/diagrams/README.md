# LangGraph Workflow System - UML Diagrams

This document provides comprehensive UML diagrams for the LangGraph-based AI Development Agent workflow system. The diagrams show the complete architecture, component relationships, execution flow, and deployment structure.

## Diagram Overview

The system is documented through five complementary UML diagrams:

1. **Class Diagram** - Shows all classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships
2. **Sequence Diagram** - Illustrates the complete workflow execution flow
3. **Activity Diagram** - Shows the decision points and process flow
4. **Component Diagram** - Displays system components and their interfaces
5. **Deployment Diagram** - Shows the runtime architecture and deployment

## 1. Class Diagram (`langgraph_workflow_class_diagram.puml`)

### Purpose
Shows the complete object-oriented structure of the LangGraph workflow system, including all classes, their relationships, and inheritance hierarchies.

### Key Components

#### Core Workflow Classes
- **LangGraphWorkflowManager**: Main orchestrator that creates and manages the workflow
- **AgentState**: TypedDict representing the complete workflow state
- **StateGraph**: LangGraph's workflow graph container

#### Memory System Classes
- **MemoryManager**: Manages long-term memory using vector stores
- **KnowledgeTriple**: Structured knowledge representation
- **MemoryEnhancedAgent**: Agent wrapper with memory capabilities

#### Handoff System Classes
- **HandoffManager**: Manages dynamic agent handoffs and validation
- **HandoffRequest**: Represents a handoff request between agents
- **HandoffValidationResult**: Result of handoff validation

#### Agent System Classes
- **AgentNodeFactory**: Factory for creating workflow nodes
- **WorkflowNode**: Base class for all agent nodes
- **ErrorHandler**: Handles errors and retries
- **QualityGate**: Validates agent outputs and workflow state

### Key Relationships
- LangGraphWorkflowManager manages AgentState and creates StateGraph
- MemoryManager uses Chroma vector store and creates KnowledgeTriple objects
- HandoffManager validates HandoffRequest objects and processes AgentState
- AgentNodeFactory creates WorkflowNode instances for different agent types

## 2. Sequence Diagram (`langgraph_workflow_sequence_diagram.puml`)

### Purpose
Illustrates the complete execution flow of the workflow system, showing how components interact over time.

### Execution Flow

#### Initialization Phase
1. User initiates workflow execution
2. LangGraphWorkflowManager sets up LLM and creates workflow
3. StateGraph is created with all agent nodes
4. Memory and Handoff managers are initialized

#### Agent Execution Phases
Each agent follows this pattern:
1. **Memory Loading**: Search for relevant memories
2. **Context Creation**: Format memories for agent consumption
3. **LLM Execution**: Execute agent with enhanced prompt
4. **Output Parsing**: Parse structured output
5. **Memory Storage**: Save agent output and extract knowledge triples
6. **Quality Validation**: Validate output quality
7. **State Update**: Update workflow state

#### Workflow Completion
1. Final state validation
2. Memory statistics generation
3. Handoff queue processing
4. Return complete project artifacts

### Key Interactions
- Each agent node interacts with MemoryManager for context
- LLM is invoked for each agent execution
- QualityGate validates outputs at each step
- HandoffManager processes any pending handoffs

## 3. Activity Diagram (`langgraph_workflow_activity_diagram.puml`)

### Purpose
Shows the decision points, error handling, and process flow of the workflow system.

### Process Flow

#### Initialization
- Setup all managers and components
- Create workflow graph with nodes and edges
- Initialize state and memory systems

#### Agent Phases
Each agent phase includes:
- Memory loading and context creation
- Agent execution with error handling
- Output validation and quality checks
- Memory storage and knowledge extraction
- State updates and handoff processing

#### Decision Points
- **Analysis Success**: Continue to next phase or handle errors
- **Design Validation**: Proceed or request handoffs
- **Code Generation**: Success or fallback handling
- **Quality Gates**: Pass validation or flag issues
- **Final State**: Complete workflow or generate error report

### Error Handling
- Each phase includes error detection and logging
- Fallback mechanisms for failed operations
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Comprehensive error reporting

## 4. Component Diagram (`langgraph_workflow_component_diagram.puml`)

### Purpose
Shows the system components, their interfaces, and how they interact at a higher level.

### Component Architecture

#### Core Components
- **LangGraphWorkflowManager**: Main workflow orchestrator
- **StateGraph**: LangGraph workflow container
- **MemoryManager**: Memory system component
- **HandoffManager**: Handoff system component
- **AgentNodeFactory**: Agent creation factory
- **WorkflowNode**: Base agent node component
- **MemoryEnhancedAgent**: Memory-enabled agent wrapper
- **ErrorHandler**: Error handling component
- **QualityGate**: Quality validation component

#### External Dependencies
