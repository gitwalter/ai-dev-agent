## 🎨 Development Task Types

### 1. ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN
```
Knowledge Sources: architecture docs, design patterns
Agents: query_analyst → retrieval → re_ranker → writer
HITL: After source selection, after pattern matching, final review
```

### 2. CODE_IMPLEMENTATION
```
Knowledge Sources: coding standards, API docs, code examples
Agents: query_analyst → multi_source_retrieval → code_synthesizer → quality_checker
HITL: After source selection, after code generation
```

### 3. API_INTEGRATION
```
Knowledge Sources: Official API docs (PRIMARY!), examples
Agents: query_analyst → api_doc_retriever → example_finder → integration_writer
HITL: After source selection, after API version confirm, after code review
```

### 4. CODE_REVIEW
```
Knowledge Sources: Coding standards, security guidelines, anti-patterns
Agents: query_analyst → standards_retriever → code_analyzer → recommendation_writer
HITL: After issue identification
```

### 5. BUG_FIXING
```
Knowledge Sources: Error pattern database, similar bug resolutions
Agents: query_analyst → error_pattern_matcher → solution_retriever → fix_generator
HITL: After root cause hypothesis, after fix generation
```

### 6. TEST_GENERATION
```
Knowledge Sources: Testing patterns, framework docs, coverage requirements

## 📚 Knowledge Source Selection (HITL #0)

### User Interface Example

```
📚 Knowledge Source Selection

I'm helping you with: 'Implement LangGraph agent with checkpointing'

To provide the best assistance, I need to know what knowledge sources to use.

Available Options:

Predefined Categories:
- architecture - Architecture documentation and patterns
- agile - Sprint plans, user stories, requirements
- coding_guidelines - Coding standards and best practices
- framework_docs - LangChain, LangGraph, API documentation

Custom Sources:
- url: https://example.com - Add website URL
- doc: /path/to/file.md - Add local document

Quick Options:
- defaults - Use project default sources
- all - Use all available sources

Format (comma-separated):
architecture, coding_guidelines, url: https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph

What knowledge sources should I use?

Your Selection: _________________________________
```

### Parsing Logic

```python
User Input: "framework_docs, url: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/, doc: specs/requirements.md"

Parsed:
{
  "categories": ["framework_docs"],
  "urls": ["https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/"],
  "documents": ["specs/requirements.md"]
}

Actions:
1. Load framework_docs from docs/development/
2. Scrape https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/
3. Load specs/requirements.md
4. Index all sources into vector store
5. Proceed to query_analyst
```

---

## 🔄 Flexible Routing

### Human Feedback Commands

```python
# Continue forward
"approve", "continue", "yes"

# Refine current stage
"refine: <feedback>", "improve: <feedback>"

# Add more sources (at retrieval stage)
"add_source: https://example.com"
"need_more"

# Go back to previous stage
"more_context" → Back to retrieval
"improve_ranking" → Retry re-ranker

# Start over
"rewrite", "restart"

# Fast-track
"skip_qa" → Skip quality assurance
"ship" → END immediately
```

---

## 💾 Long-Running Projects

### Multi-Session Example

```python
# Session 1: Start project, select sources
result = coordinator.execute(
    "Design architecture for RAG document pipeline",
    human_in_loop=True,
    thread_id="architecture_project_123"
)
# → Interrupts at HITL #0 (knowledge sources)
# User: "architecture, design_patterns, url: https://langchain.com/docs"
# → Loads sources, continues to query_analyst
# → Interrupts at HITL #1 (query understanding)
# User approves, continues...
# → Interrupts at HITL #2 (retrieval results)
# User pauses session (needs to think)

# Session 2: Resume next day
result = coordinator.resume(
    thread_id="architecture_project_123",
    human_input="approve"  # Approve retrieval results
)
# → Continues from HITL #2
# → Goes through re-ranker, writer, QA
# → User iteratively refines through remaining stages

# Session 3: Final refinements
result = coordinator.resume(
    thread_id="architecture_project_123",
    human_input="revise: add performance considerations"
)
# → Goes back to writer with feedback
# → Human approves final version
```
