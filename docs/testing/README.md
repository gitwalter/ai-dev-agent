# Testing Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive testing documentation for the AI Development Agent system.

## Overview

The testing strategy follows test-driven development principles with comprehensive coverage across all system components and layers.

## Test Organization

### Test Categories

- **[Unit Testing](unit_testing.md)** - Component-level testing for individual functions and classes
- **[Integration Testing](integration_testing.md)** - Testing component interactions and API endpoints
- **[System Testing](system_testing.md)** - End-to-end testing of complete workflows
- **[Performance Testing](performance_testing.md)** - Load testing and performance validation
- **[Security Testing](security_testing.md)** - Security vulnerability and compliance testing

### Testing Infrastructure

- **[Test Fixtures](test_fixtures.md)** - Shared test data and setup utilities
- **[Mocking Guide](mocking_guide.md)** - Mock objects and test isolation strategies
- **[Test Development Plan](TEST_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)** - LangGraph-specific testing approaches

## Test Organization Rules

See **[Test Organization Rules](TEST_ORGANIZATION_RULES.md)** for detailed guidelines on:
- Test file structure and naming
- Test category organization
- Code coverage requirements
- Testing best practices

## Test Suite Summary

The **[Test Suite Summary](TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md)** provides:
- Current test coverage metrics
- Test execution status
- Performance benchmarks
- Quality gates and validation

## Testing Frameworks and Tools

### Primary Testing Stack
- **pytest** - Main testing framework
- **pytest-cov** - Coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio** - Async testing support
- **unittest.mock** - Mocking framework

### Specialized Testing Tools
- **LangSmith** - LLM agent testing and tracing
- **httpx** - HTTP client testing
- **Streamlit testing** - UI component testing
- **Database testing** - Transaction isolation and cleanup

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/
pytest tests/integration/
pytest tests/system/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run performance tests
pytest tests/performance/
```

### Continuous Integration
- All tests run automatically on git push (via pre-push hooks)
- Coverage reports generated and tracked
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Quality Gates

Tests must pass the following quality gates:
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 80%
- **Integration Test Coverage**: Minimum 60%
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100%
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Within acceptable thresholds
- **Security Scans**: No high-severity vulnerabilities

## Best Practices

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
2. **Isolated Testing**: Tests must not depend on external services
3. **Deterministic Tests**: No false positives or flaky tests
4. **Clear Assertions**: Tests assert real working, productive code
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test normal, edge, and error cases
