# Perspective Switching as Ontological Transitions

**Mode switching is perspective switching - each mode represents a distinct ontological framework with its own language system, meaning structures, and conceptual boundaries. These ontologies must never be mixed.**

## Core Principle: Ontological Purity

**"Each perspective has its own complete world of meaning. Never contaminate one with another."**

When we switch from `@engineering` to `@architecture`, we're not just changing tools - we're **switching entire ontological frameworks** with different:
- **Language games** (Wittgensteinian)
- **Conceptual structures** (what exists, what matters)
- **Reasoning patterns** (how truth is determined)
- **Valid expressions** (what can be meaningfully said)

## Ontological Framework Definitions

### @engineering Ontology
```yaml
world_view: "Reality consists of code, tests, performance metrics, and deployable systems"
language_system:
  - primary_concepts: ["function", "class", "test", "bug", "deployment", "performance"]
  - truth_criteria: "Does it work? Do tests pass? Is it maintainable?"
  - reasoning_pattern: "Evidence-based, test-driven, pragmatic validation"
  - valid_expressions: ["implement", "test", "debug", "optimize", "deploy"]
  - invalid_expressions: ["design philosophy", "long-term vision", "conceptual beauty"]

meaning_structure:
  - success: "All tests pass, performance meets requirements"
  - problem: "Tests fail, performance degrades, bugs in production"
  - solution: "Write code, fix bugs, optimize algorithms"
  - quality: "Clean code, good test coverage, reliable operation"

conceptual_boundaries:
  - what_exists: "Code files, test suites, runtime systems, performance metrics"
  - what_matters: "Functionality, reliability, performance, maintainability"
  - time_horizon: "Current sprint, immediate delivery"
  - success_metrics: "Feature completion, bug counts, performance numbers"
```

### @architecture Ontology
```yaml
world_view: "Reality consists of systems, patterns, relationships, and long-term evolution"
language_system:
  - primary_concepts: ["component", "pattern", "relationship", "evolution", "scalability"]
  - truth_criteria: "Is it well-designed? Will it scale? Is it maintainable long-term?"
  - reasoning_pattern: "Pattern-based, system-thinking, future-oriented analysis"
  - valid_expressions: ["design", "pattern", "structure", "evolve", "integrate"]
  - invalid_expressions: ["quick fix", "just make it work", "technical debt acceptable"]

meaning_structure:
  - success: "Elegant design, clear patterns, sustainable growth"
  - problem: "Poor structure, tight coupling, architectural debt"
  - solution: "Apply patterns, refactor structure, design for evolution"
  - quality: "Clear separation of concerns, flexible architecture, scalable design"

conceptual_boundaries:
  - what_exists: "Components, interfaces, patterns, relationships, abstractions"
  - what_matters: "Structure, maintainability, evolution, elegant design"
  - time_horizon: "Multiple years, long-term sustainability"
  - success_metrics: "Architectural clarity, coupling metrics, evolution capacity"
```

### @debug Ontology
```yaml
world_view: "Reality consists of observable symptoms, hidden causes, and investigatable systems"
language_system:
  - primary_concepts: ["symptom", "hypothesis", "test", "evidence", "root_cause"]
  - truth_criteria: "Is it reproducible? Does evidence support hypothesis?"
  - reasoning_pattern: "Scientific method, systematic elimination, evidence-gathering"
  - valid_expressions: ["reproduce", "isolate", "hypothesize", "verify", "eliminate"]
  - invalid_expressions: ["probably works", "good enough", "ship it anyway"]

meaning_structure:
  - success: "Root cause identified, fix verified, no regressions"
  - problem: "Unreproducible symptoms, multiple possible causes"
  - solution: "Systematic investigation, hypothesis testing, controlled fixes"
  - quality: "Thorough investigation, verified fixes, prevented regressions"

conceptual_boundaries:
  - what_exists: "Symptoms, logs, stack traces, system states, test conditions"
  - what_matters: "Reproducibility, evidence, systematic investigation"
  - time_horizon: "Until problem is completely resolved"
  - success_metrics: "Problem resolution, fix verification, prevention success"
```

## Ontological Separation Rules

### 1. **Complete Language System Switch**
```python
# CORRECT: Complete ontological transition
@engineering → @architecture:
  # Engineering ontology COMPLETELY deactivated
  # Architecture ontology COMPLETELY activated
  # No mixing of concepts, language, or reasoning patterns

# FORBIDDEN: Ontological contamination  
@engineering + @architecture concepts:
  # "Let's quickly design this component while implementing"
  # This mixes immediate implementation focus with long-term design thinking
  # Results in confused reasoning and poor outcomes
```

### 2. **Distinct Truth Criteria**
```python
# @engineering truth: "Does the code work?"
if tests_pass and performance_acceptable:
    return "engineering_success"

# @architecture truth: "Is the design elegant and sustainable?"  
if pattern_clarity and low_coupling and evolution_capacity:
    return "architecture_success"

# FORBIDDEN: Mixed truth criteria
# "The code works but the design is messy" ← This tries to evaluate with both ontologies simultaneously
```

### 3. **Pure Reasoning Patterns**
```yaml
@engineering_reasoning:
  pattern: "Test → Implement → Verify → Deploy"
  focus: "Make it work reliably"
  evidence: "Test results, performance metrics"

@architecture_reasoning:  
  pattern: "Analyze → Design → Pattern → Validate"
  focus: "Make it elegant and sustainable"
  evidence: "Design clarity, coupling analysis, evolution scenarios"

@debug_reasoning:
  pattern: "Observe → Hypothesize → Test → Verify"
  focus: "Find and fix root cause"
  evidence: "Reproduction steps, logs, systematic elimination"
```

## Practical Examples of Clean Ontological Switching

### Example 1: Engineering → Architecture Switch
```python
# Current: @engineering ontology
expression = "Let's optimize this algorithm for performance"
validation = system.validate_current_expression(expression)
# Result: Valid - aligns with engineering focus on performance

# Switch perspective
system.switch_perspective("architecture", "Need to design long-term structure")

# Now: @architecture ontology  
expression = "Let's optimize this algorithm for performance"
validation = system.validate_current_expression(expression)
# Result: Invalid - architecture ontology focuses on structure, not immediate optimization

# Correct expression in architecture ontology:
expression = "Let's design the algorithm interface for future extensibility"
validation = system.validate_current_expression(expression)
# Result: Valid - aligns with architectural thinking
```

### Example 2: Debug → Engineering Switch
```python
# Current: @debug ontology
expression = "Let's ship this fix quickly"
validation = system.validate_current_expression(expression)
# Result: Invalid - debug ontology requires thorough verification

# Correct expression in debug ontology:
expression = "Let's verify this fix resolves the root cause without regressions"
validation = system.validate_current_expression(expression)
# Result: Valid - aligns with systematic debugging approach

# Switch perspective
system.switch_perspective("engineering", "Root cause fixed, continue implementation")

# Now: @engineering ontology
expression = "Let's ship this fix quickly"  
validation = system.validate_current_expression(expression)
# Result: Valid - engineering ontology allows pragmatic shipping decisions
```

## Benefits of Ontological Purity

### 1. **Clear Thinking**
- No confused reasoning from mixed perspectives
- Each mode has complete internal consistency
- Decisions align with appropriate truth criteria

### 2. **Effective Communication**
- Clear language system for each context
- No ambiguity from mixed conceptual frameworks
- Precise meaning within each ontological boundary

### 3. **Better Outcomes**
- Each perspective optimizes for its domain
- No compromised solutions from ontological mixing
- Clean separation enables deep expertise in each mode

### 4. **Natural Human Experience**
- Matches how humans actually switch perspectives
- Reduces cognitive load by eliminating ontological conflicts
- Enables flow state within each perspective

## Conclusion

**Mode switching is ontological switching** - complete transitions between distinct worlds of meaning. Each perspective has its own language system, conceptual boundaries, and truth criteria.

**The key insight**: Never mix ontologies. Each must be pure, complete, and internally consistent.

**"The perspective IS the reality"** - when in @engineering mode, the engineering ontology defines what exists, what matters, and what success means. When in @architecture mode, the architectural ontology becomes the complete framework for understanding.

This creates the **natural perspective switching** that humans experience, implemented with the **ontological rigor** that ensures clean, effective reasoning within each framework.
