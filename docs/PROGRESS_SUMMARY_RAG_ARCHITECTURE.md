# RAG Architecture Progress Summary

## üéØ What We Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Complete Redesign of RAG System

We transformed the RAG system from a simplified tool-based approach back to a **sophisticated, flexible, human-guided multi-agent system** specifically designed for development workflows.

---

## üìä Key Features Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Sophisticated Multi-Agent Workflow Restored

**5 Specialized Agents**:
- **QueryAnalystAgent**: Deep query understanding and intent classification
- **RetrievalSpecialistAgent**: Multi-source retrieval orchestration
- **ReRankerAgent**: Relevance scoring and quality filtering
- **QualityAssuranceAgent**: Comprehensive quality validation
- **WriterAgent**: Sophisticated answer synthesis with citations

### 2. ‚úÖ Human-in-the-Loop First (6 Strategic Checkpoints)

**HITL #0: Knowledge Source Selection** ‚Üê **NEW! Your requirement!**
- User specifies which knowledge sources to use AT THE START
- Options:
  - Predefined categories (architecture, agile, coding_guidelines, framework_docs)
  - Custom URLs (API docs, tutorials, references)
  - Local documents (upload specs, designs, notes)
  - Quick options: "defaults", "all"

**HITL #1-5**: Query analysis, retrieval review, context approval, draft review, final approval

### 3. ‚úÖ Task-Adaptive Architecture

**Development Task Types Defined**:
- ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN
- CODE_IMPLEMENTATION
- API_INTEGRATION
- CODE_REVIEW
- BUG_FIXING
- TEST_GENERATION
- REFACTORING
- DOCUMENTATION_WRITING
- AGILE_CONTEXT_RETRIEVAL

Each task type gets optimized agent combinations and HITL checkpoints.

### 4. ‚úÖ Flexible Routing Based on Feedback

Human can provide rich feedback:
- "approve" ‚Üí Continue
- "refine: <feedback>" ‚Üí Improve current stage
- "add_source: <url>" ‚Üí Add specific knowledge source
- "need_more" ‚Üí Get more context
- "rewrite" ‚Üí Start over with new understanding
- "skip_qa" ‚Üí Fast-track
- "ship" ‚Üí Complete immediately

### 5. ‚úÖ Long-Running Project Support

- **Thread-based state persistence**: Full conversation history maintained
- **Multi-session support**: Pause and resume anytime
- **Checkpointing**: State saved at each step
- **Iterative refinement**: Multiple passes through workflow

## üìù What's Left to Implement

### Phase 1: Complete HITL Nodes (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement remaining 5 HITL review nodes
- [ ] Implement routing functions for each checkpoint
- [ ] Test interrupt and resume flow

### Phase 2: Real Knowledge Source Integration (High Priority)
- [ ] Integrate with KnowledgeSourceManager
- [ ] Implement real URL scraping (BeautifulSoup)
- [ ] Implement document upload handling
- [ ] Implement category-based document loading

### Phase 3: UI Enhancement (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Build knowledge source selection UI in Streamlit
- [ ] Add file upload widget
- [ ] Add URL input field
- [ ] Display active sources
- [ ] Show agent progress
- [ ] Rich feedback forms for each HITL stage

### Phase 4: Task Adaptation (Medium Priority)

2. **Agent implementations** - All 5 agents callable
3. **HITL checkpoints** - Interrupt configuration set
4. **Knowledge source selection** - Node implemented
5. **State persistence** - Checkpointing active
6. **Thread management** - Works across sessions

### What Will Partially Work:
- Workflow will execute through all stages
- HITL interrupts will trigger
- Knowledge source selection will display prompt
- Loading will acknowledge (but not actually load yet)

### What Needs Completion:
- Real URL scraping
- Real document loading/indexing
- Remaining HITL review node implementations
- Routing function implementations
