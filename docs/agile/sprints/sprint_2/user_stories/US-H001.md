# User Story US-H001: Holistic Web Integrity Management System

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: US-H001  
**Title**: Self-Healing Interconnection Web Integrity Management System  
**Story Points**: 34  
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned  
**Assignee**: Holistic Web Integrity Specialist Team  
**Dependencies**: US-E0-010 (File Organization Rule), Naming Convention System  

## Story Description

**As a** development system committed to holistic thinking and systematic excellence  
**I want** an intelligent self-healing web integrity management system that automatically maintains all relationships, interconnections, hyperlinks, imports, and dependencies  
**So that** our project remains a coherent, interconnected web where no relationships are broken when files are moved, renamed, or reorganized  

### **CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: "Never Break the Web"**

Every file rename, move, or organizational change must **automatically cascade** to update:
- **Hyperlinks** in documentation (markdown links, references)
- **Import statements** in Python code
- **File path references** in configuration files
- **Catalog entries** and indexes
- **Cross-references** between agile artifacts
- **Documentation links** and internal navigation
- **Script references** and automation paths
- **Test file references** and test data paths

## Business Justification

**CRITICAL** for maintaining system integrity and preventing broken relationships that destroy the interconnected nature of our development ecosystem. When the web breaks, the system becomes fragmented, automation fails, and development efficiency plummets.

**Strategic Value:**
- **Maintains System Coherence**: Preserves the holistic nature of the project
- **Prevents Broken Links**: Eliminates dead hyperlinks and missing references
- **Enables Safe Refactoring**: Allows confident reorganization without fear of breaking connections
- **Reduces Manual Maintenance**: Automates the tedious work of updating references
- **Supports Boy Scout Rule**: Enables cleanup without destroying existing relationships

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC-H001-1: Intelligent Relationship Discovery**
- **GIVEN** any file in the project
- **WHEN** the system scans for relationships
- **THEN** it discovers and catalogs all incoming and outgoing relationships:
  - Hyperlinks (markdown `[text](path)` and `[text]: path`)
  - Import statements (`import`, `from ... import`)
  - File path references in configs, scripts, and documentation
  - Cross-references in agile artifacts
  - Image references and asset links
  - Test file and data references

### **AC-H001-2: Automated Relationship Updates**
- **GIVEN** a file is renamed or moved
- **WHEN** the holistic system detects the change
- **THEN** it automatically updates all references to that file:
  - Updates all hyperlinks pointing to the file
  - Modifies import statements in Python files
  - Adjusts file paths in configuration files
  - Updates catalog entries and indexes
  - Maintains cross-reference integrity
  - Preserves documentation navigation

### **AC-H001-3: Self-Healing Cascade Updates**
- **GIVEN** multiple files are reorganized in a Boy Scout cleanup
- **WHEN** the naming convention validator moves files
- **THEN** the web integrity system cascades updates automatically:
  - Processes all moves in dependency order
  - Updates references in batches to prevent conflicts
  - Validates all updates for correctness
  - Reports any unresolvable dependencies
  - Maintains audit trail of all changes

### **AC-H001-4: Relationship Validation and Reporting**
- **GIVEN** the project's current state
- **WHEN** the system performs integrity validation
- **THEN** it provides comprehensive reporting:
  - Identifies all broken links and references
  - Reports orphaned files with no incoming references
  - Detects circular dependencies and reference loops
  - Provides relationship graphs and dependency maps
  - Suggests corrections for broken relationships

### **AC-H001-5: Safe Integration with Boy Scout Rule**
- **GIVEN** the naming convention validator wants to fix violations
- **WHEN** it requests file moves or renames
- **THEN** the web integrity system ensures safe operations:
  - Pre-validates all planned moves for safety
  - Calculates update impact and dependency chains
  - Executes moves in correct dependency order
  - Updates all relationships before completing moves
  - Rolls back changes if integrity cannot be maintained

## Technical Requirements

### **Core Components**

#### **1. Relationship Discovery Engine**
```python
class RelationshipDiscoveryEngine:
    """
    Discovers all types of relationships in the project.
    """
    
    def discover_relationships(self, file_path: Path) -> RelationshipMap:
        """Discover all relationships for a given file."""
        
    def scan_markdown_links(self, content: str) -> List[Link]:
        """Extract markdown hyperlinks and references."""
        
    def scan_python_imports(self, content: str) -> List[Import]:
        """Extract Python import statements."""
        
    def scan_config_references(self, content: str) -> List[Reference]:
        """Extract file path references in config files."""
```

#### **2. Web Integrity Manager**
```python
class WebIntegrityManager:
    """
    Maintains the integrity of the interconnected web.
    """
    
    def update_relationships(self, old_path: Path, new_path: Path) -> UpdateResult:
        """Update all references when a file is moved."""
        
    def validate_integrity(self) -> IntegrityReport:
        """Validate the entire web for broken relationships."""
        
    def plan_safe_moves(self, planned_moves: List[Move]) -> ExecutionPlan:
        """Plan safe execution of multiple file moves."""
```

#### **3. Holistic Update Coordinator**
```python
class HolisticUpdateCoordinator:
    """
    Coordinates holistic updates across the entire system.
    """
    
    def coordinate_boy_scout_cleanup(self, violations: List[NamingViolation]) -> None:
        """Coordinate naming fixes with relationship updates."""
        
    def execute_holistic_move(self, move_plan: ExecutionPlan) -> ExecutionResult:
