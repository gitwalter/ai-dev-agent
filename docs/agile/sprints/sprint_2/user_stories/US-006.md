### **Swarm Coordination Framework**
```python
class SwarmCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, agents: List[BaseAgent]):
        self.agents = agents
        self.task_queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.coordination_protocols = CoordinationProtocols()
        
    def coordinate_agents(self, project_context: str) -> SwarmResult:
        # Intelligent task distribution
        # Agent capability matching
        # Performance optimization
        pass
```

### **Agent Communication Protocol**
```yaml
communication_protocol:
  message_types:
    - "task_assignment"
    - "context_sharing"
    - "result_communication"
    - "coordination_request"
    
  message_format:
    sender_id: str
    receiver_id: str
    message_type: str
    payload: dict
    timestamp: datetime
    priority: int
```
