**Epic**: EPIC-7 - Formal Principles Excellence


## Story Overview
**Story ID**: US-L0-01  
**Title**: Prompt Engineering Elementary Operations  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Sprint 2  
**Assignee**: AI Team  
**Construction Level**: Level 0 (Elementary Operations)

## Constitutional Definition

```
PromptOperation(p) ↔ (Store(p) ∧ Retrieve(p) ∧ Validate(p) ∧ Optimize(p))
```

Following Carnap's constitutional method, all prompt engineering capabilities will be constructed from these four elementary operations.

## Story Description

As a development team following Carnap's logical construction principles, we need elementary prompt engineering operations that serve as the basic constitutional elements for all higher-level AI agent intelligence, ensuring that every complex prompt capability can be reduced to these verified, elementary operations.

    version TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    performance_score REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    validation_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
);

-- Elementary operation tracking

## Testing Requirements

### **Protocol Sentence Verification**
- [ ] All operations generate verifiable protocol sentences
- [ ] Protocol sentences immediately testable through automated verification
- [ ] Performance protocol sentences validate operation speed requirements
- [ ] Success protocol sentences validate operation correctness

### **Constitutional Consistency Testing**
- [ ] All operations consistent with constitutional definitions
- [ ] Operations form complete basis for Level 1 construction
- [ ] No logical contradictions between operations
- [ ] Operations maintain logical relationships under all conditions

## Definition of Done

### **Carnap Constitutional Requirements**
- [ ] All four elementary operations implemented and tested
- [ ] Constitutional definitions formally verified
- [ ] Protocol sentences generated and verified for all operations
- [ ] Performance requirements met for elementary level
- [ ] Operations ready for Level 1 constitutional construction
- [ ] Complete empirical verification through systematic testing

### **Quality Requirements**
- [ ] 100% test coverage for all elementary operations
- [ ] <100ms performance for all elementary operations
- [ ] Zero silent failures (following No Silent Errors rule)

## Dependencies

- ✅ **Sprint 1 Foundation**: Complete test infrastructure and database systems
- ✅ **Database Infrastructure**: Prompt database tables and connections ready
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Systematic testing infrastructure operational

## Risks and Mitigation

### **Risk**: Elementary operations may seem too simple
**Mitigation**: Remember Carnap's insight - complex intelligence MUST be buildable from simple elements. Simplicity at this level enables complexity at higher levels.

### **Risk**: Pressure to add complexity prematurely  
**Mitigation**: Follow constitutional method strictly - no Level 1 construction until Level 0 is constitutionally complete.

## Success Metrics

- **Operation Success Rate**: 100% for all elementary operations
- **Performance**: All operations <100ms (elementary requirement)
- **Constitutional Completeness**: All prompt capabilities reducible to these operations
- **Logical Consistency**: Zero logical contradictions or inconsistencies
- **Empirical Verification**: 100% protocol sentence verification success

**Constitutional Success**: This story succeeds when all prompt engineering capabilities can be constitutionally constructed from these four elementary operations, following Carnap's systematic method.
