## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Current Violations Identified**
Based on expert team analysis, we found **30 file organization violations**:

1. **Root Directory Clutter**: 20+ files scattered in root
2. **Misplaced Test Files**: `test_*.py` files in root instead of `tests/`
3. **Temporary Files**: Multiple `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_ANALYSIS.md` files in root
4. **Script Files**: `run_*.py` files that should be in `scripts/`
5. **Utility Files**: `*_script.py`, `update_*.py` files that should be in `utils/`

### **Agent Inner Principles Implementation**
Successfully embedded directory structure principles into agent DNA:

```python
# INNER PRINCIPLES: Directory structure rules embedded in agent DNA
self.directory_structure_principles = {
    "agents/": "AI agent implementations and orchestration - ALL agent files here",
    "apps/": "Streamlit applications and UI components - ALL UI files here", 
    "context/": "Context management and processing - ALL context files here",
    "models/": "Data models and schemas - ALL model files here",
    "utils/": "Utility functions and helper modules - ALL utility files here",
    "workflow/": "Workflow management and orchestration - ALL workflow files here",
    "scripts/": "Utility scripts and automation tools - ALL script files here",
    "tests/": "ALL test files and test utilities - NO EXCEPTIONS",
    "monitoring/": "System monitoring and observability - ALL monitoring files here",
    "logs/": "Application logs and debugging - ALL log files here",
    "docs/": "Project documentation and guides - ALL documentation here",
    "prompts/": "Prompt templates and management - ALL prompt files here",
    "ROOT_FORBIDDEN": "test_*.py, run_*.py, *_script.py, *_util.py, temp files, summary files"
}
