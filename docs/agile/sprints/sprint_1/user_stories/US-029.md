# User Story US-029: Agile Artifact Naming Convention Standardization System

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: US-029  
**Title**: Agile Artifact Naming Convention Standardization System  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: 🟡 High  
**Status**: To Do  
**Assignee**: AI Team  
**Dependencies**: None  

## Story Description

Establish strict, uniform, and clear naming conventions for ALL agile artifacts throughout the project.
Create comprehensive documentation, implement enforcement rules, and systematically rename existing 
files to follow the new standards. This addresses the current inconsistency where some files use 
UPPER-CASE-WITH-HYPHENS (like EPIC-FORMAL-PRINCIPLES.md) while others use lowercase_with_underscores.

CURRENT INCONSISTENCIES TO RESOLVE:
- Epic files: EPIC-FORMAL-PRINCIPLES.md (UPPER-CASE-WITH-HYPHENS) 
- User stories: US-028.md (US-XXX format - correct)
- Sprint summaries: SPRINT_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md (UPPER_WITH_UNDERSCORES)
- Regular files: sprint_1_retrospective.md (lowercase_with_underscores)
- Folder names: sprint_1 (lowercase_with_underscores - correct)

SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Document strict naming convention rules for all artifact types
2. Implement rule system enforcement for agents maintaining artifacts
3. Create automated validation and correction tools
4. Systematically rename all existing non-compliant files
5. Integrate validation into agile automation system
6. Provide clear examples and enforcement mechanisms

This ensures professional consistency and eliminates confusion in navigation and automation.


## Business Justification

CRITICAL for maintaining professional standards and enabling reliable automation. Inconsistent naming 
creates confusion, breaks automation scripts, and reduces team efficiency. Clear naming conventions are 
fundamental to systematic development excellence and enable:

- Reliable automation and scripting
- Consistent team navigation and understanding
- Professional appearance to stakeholders
- Reduced cognitive load and errors
- Systematic artifact organization
- Integration with development tools and processes

This directly supports our goal of crystal-clear development practices and systematic excellence.
