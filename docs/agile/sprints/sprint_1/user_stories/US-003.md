## Technical Implementation

### **Cleanup Framework Architecture**
```python
# Example cleanup framework
class DatabaseCleanupManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cleanup_rules = {
            'agent_logs': {
                'retention_days': 7,
                'frequency': 'daily',
                'safety_level': 'low'
            },
            'prompt_templates': {
                'retention_days': 30,
                'frequency': 'daily', 
                'safety_level': 'medium'
            },
            'session_data': {
                'retention_hours': 4,
                'frequency': 'hourly',
                'safety_level': 'high'
            }
        }
    
    def execute_cleanup(self, rule_name):
        rule = self.cleanup_rules[rule_name]
        if rule['safety_level'] == 'high':
            self.create_backup()
        
        return self.perform_cleanup(rule)
