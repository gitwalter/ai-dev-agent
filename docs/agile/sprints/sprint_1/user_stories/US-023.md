# User Story US-023: Fix Health Dashboard NumPy 2.0 Compatibility Error

**Epic**: EPIC-8 - Developer Delight & Maximum Usefulness


## Story Overview
**Story ID**: US-023  
**Title**: Fix Health Dashboard NumPy 2.0 Compatibility Error  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Assignee**: AI Team  
**Dependencies**: None  

## Story Description
The health dashboard fails to load due to NumPy 2.0 compatibility issues.
The error occurs in the dependency chain: health_dashboard.py â†’ plotly.express â†’ xarray â†’ dask â†’ np.round_ (deprecated).

Error: AttributeError: `np.round_` was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release. Use `np.round` instead.

This issue prevents:
- System health monitoring dashboard access
- Agent status visualization  
- Performance metrics display
- Real-time system health tracking

The fix requires updating the dependency chain to use NumPy 2.0 compatible versions
or implementing alternative visualization solutions.

## Business Justification
CRITICAL SYSTEM RESTORATION: The health dashboard is a core operational tool that provides:
- Real-time system health visibility
- Agent performance monitoring
- Proactive issue identification
- Development productivity support

Without the dashboard:
- System health is invisible to the team
- Issues cannot be detected proactively  
- US-001 (System Health Monitoring) is blocked
- Development efficiency is reduced
- System reliability is compromised
