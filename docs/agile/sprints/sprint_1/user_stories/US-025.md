# User Story US-025: Implement Strategic Rule Selection System for Token Efficiency

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: US-025  
**Title**: Implement Strategic Rule Selection System for Token Efficiency  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Status**: Completed  
**Assignee**: AI Team  
**Dependencies**: None  

## Story Description
Create a high-performance, token-efficient rule selection system that intelligently chooses only the most relevant rules for each task, dramatically reducing token costs while maintaining excellence standards. This system replaces the inefficient "all rules always active" approach with a sophisticated, context-aware selection mechanism that can reduce token usage by 60-80% while improving rule effectiveness.

## Business Justification
Current system has all 22 rules always active, costing excessive tokens and reducing efficiency. Strategic rule selection will dramatically reduce costs while maintaining quality, enabling more efficient development and better resource utilization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Strategic rule selector intelligently analyzes task context and selects optimal rules
- [x] System reduces token usage by 60-80% while maintaining excellence standards
- [x] Rule profiles include token costs, effectiveness scores, and context relevance
- [x] Parallel execution groups are generated for optimal rule application
- [x] Comprehensive database tracks rule selection performance and learning
- [x] System provides detailed reasoning for rule selection decisions
- [x] Performance metrics and optimization reports are generated automatically
- [x] Integration with existing rule optimization systems is seamless

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [x] Code reviewed and approved
- [x] All tests written and passing
- [x] Documentation updated and accurate
- [x] Integration testing completed
- [x] No regressions introduced
- [x] Performance requirements met
- [x] Security requirements validated
