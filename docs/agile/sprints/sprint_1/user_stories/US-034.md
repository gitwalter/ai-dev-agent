## üìã **User Story**

**As a** AI development agent and any writing agent in the system  
**I want** instant access to standardized commands and file paths without repetitive searching  
**So that** I can work at maximum velocity without wasting time on location discovery

## üéØ **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Primary Requirements**

1. **‚úÖ Quick Reference Integration**
   - All agile rules must contain exact paths to artifacts
   - File organization rules must reference real existing documents  
   - No placeholder paths or broken references allowed
   - All paths verified to exist in current project structure

2. **‚úÖ Standardized Command Library**
   - Working commands documented in rules (not trial-and-error)
   - Windows-specific commands for this environment
   - Exact Anaconda paths included for Python operations
   - Test commands, file operations, and health checks standardized

3. **‚úÖ Agent Knowledge Base**
   - Every writing agent can access path information instantly
   - No codebase searching required for common operations
   - Standardized import patterns and file movement commands
   - Quick reference sections in relevant rule documents

4. **‚úÖ Velocity Optimization**
   - Eliminate repetitive path discovery operations
   - Reduce development time for common tasks
   - Prevent broken references and dead links
   - Speed up agile artifact access and updates

### **Technical Implementation**

1. **Rule Document Updates**
   - ‚úÖ Update `docs/agile/core/agile_cursor_rules.md` with Quick Reference
   - ‚úÖ Update `docs/development/FILE_ORGANIZATION_STANDARDS.md` with real paths
   - Add command library to development rules
   - Create standardized import path documentation

2. **Path Verification System**
   - Automated verification that all referenced paths exist
   - Broken link detection and reporting
   - Path update automation when project structure changes
   - Regular validation of command effectiveness

3. **Agent Integration**
   - Quick reference access for all AI agents
   - Standardized path resolution in agent code
   - Common command execution patterns
   - Error-free file operations

## üèóÔ∏è **Implementation Approach**

### **Phase 1: Rule Document Enhancement** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
