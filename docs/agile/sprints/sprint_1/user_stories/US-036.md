# User Story US-036: Context-Aware Development Mode Switching System

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: US-036  
**Title**: Context-Aware Development Mode Switching System  
**Story Points**: 144  
**Priority**: üü° High  
**Status**: üìã Ready  
**Assignee**: AI Team  
**Dependencies**: US-035 Foundation-Practical Architecture  

## Story Description

**INTELLIGENT DEVELOPMENT**: Implement automated switching between foundational work and practical development based on context detection and project needs.

As a **System Developer** using the AI-Dev-Agent system, I want **automatic mode switching between foundational and practical development** so that **the system intelligently applies deep architectural thinking when needed and fast practical development when appropriate**.

### The Vision: Intelligent Mode Switching

Building on our **Dual-Mode Development Strategy** and **Context-Aware Agent System**, create a system that automatically detects when to apply:

1. **üèóÔ∏è Foundation Mode**: Deep architectural thinking, philosophical grounding, comprehensive analysis
2. **‚ö° Practical Mode**: Fast implementation, focused delivery, immediate results

### Context-Based Mode Detection

```yaml
foundation_mode_triggers:
  - New architectural patterns needed
  - System-wide changes required  
  - Philosophical alignment questions
  - Complex ethical considerations
  - Long-term strategic decisions
  - "@architecture-large" contexts
  - "@design-comprehensive" contexts

practical_mode_triggers:
  - Feature implementation requests
  - Bug fixes and debugging
  - Testing and validation
  - Documentation updates
  - "@code-small" and "@code-medium" contexts
  - "@debug" contexts
  - "@test" contexts
```
