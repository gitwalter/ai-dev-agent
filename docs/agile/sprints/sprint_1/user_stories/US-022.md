# User Story US-022: Health Dashboard NumPy Compatibility Fix

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: US-022  
**Title**: Health Dashboard NumPy Compatibility Fix  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Assignee**: AI Team  
**Dependencies**: None (Standalone Bug Fix)  

## Story Description
As a system administrator and development team, we need the health dashboard to function properly without NumPy 2.0 compatibility errors, so that we can monitor system health and agent status effectively without interruption.

## Business Justification
**CRITICAL BUG FIX**: The health dashboard is currently unusable due to NumPy compatibility issues:
- System health monitoring is broken and inaccessible
- Cannot view agent status or system metrics
- Blocks US-001 (System Health Monitoring) progress
- Prevents operational visibility into system health
- Impacts development productivity and system reliability

## Problem Analysis
The health dashboard fails to load due to NumPy 2.0 compatibility:
```
AttributeError: `np.round_` was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release. Use `np.round` instead.
```

**Root Cause**: Dependency chain issue:
- `health_dashboard.py` imports `plotly.express`
- `plotly` depends on `xarray`
- `xarray` depends on `dask`
- `dask.array.routines` references deprecated `np.round_`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Health dashboard loads without NumPy errors
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: All dashboard functionality works as expected
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: No regression in existing health monitoring features
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Dependencies are compatible and stable
- [ ] Dashboard displays agent status correctly
- [ ] Performance metrics charts render properly
- [ ] System health metrics are accurate
- [ ] No other NumPy compatibility issues remain

## Technical Implementation

### **Root Cause Resolution Strategy**
1. **Version Compatibility Analysis**: Check all NumPy-dependent packages
2. **Dependency Update**: Update packages to NumPy 2.0 compatible versions
3. **Alternative Package Assessment**: Evaluate alternative visualization libraries if needed
4. **Testing**: Verify all dashboard functionality after fixes

### **Affected Components**
- `utils/health_dashboard.py` - Main dashboard module
- `requirements.txt` - Package dependencies
- Health monitoring system integration
- Plotly visualizations and charts

### **Implementation Approach**
```python
# Current problematic dependency chain:
health_dashboard.py â†’ plotly.express â†’ xarray â†’ dask â†’ np.round_ (deprecated)

# Solution options:
1. Update dask to NumPy 2.0 compatible version
2. Pin NumPy to 1.x until all dependencies are compatible
3. Replace plotly with alternative visualization library
4. Use conda environment with compatible versions
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Health dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] All visualization components render correctly
- [ ] System health metrics display accurately
- [ ] Agent status information shows properly
- [ ] Performance charts and gauges work
- [ ] Dependencies are documented and stable
- [ ] No NumPy compatibility warnings or errors
- [ ] Integration with health monitoring system verified
- [ ] Requirements.txt updated with compatible versions
- [ ] Testing completed on target environment

## Tasks Breakdown
| Task | Estimate (hrs) | Status | Priority | Dependencies | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Analyze NumPy dependency conflicts** | 0.5 | To Do | ðŸ”´ Critical | None | Version analysis |
| **Update package dependencies** | 1 | To Do | ðŸ”´ Critical | Task 1 | Requirements update |
| **Test health dashboard functionality** | 1 | To Do | ðŸ”´ Critical | Task 2 | Verification |
| **Validate all visualization components** | 0.5 | To Do | ðŸŸ¡ High | Task 3 | Chart testing |

## Technical Solution Options

### **Option 1: Update Dependencies (Recommended)**
- Update `dask` to NumPy 2.0 compatible version
- Update `xarray` to latest compatible version
- Verify `plotly` compatibility
- Test all visualizations

### **Option 2: NumPy Version Pinning (Temporary)**
- Pin NumPy to 1.x in requirements.txt
- Document as technical debt
- Plan future migration to NumPy 2.0

### **Option 3: Alternative Visualization Library**
- Replace plotly with matplotlib/seaborn
- Rewrite visualization code
- Higher effort but more control

## Success Metrics
- **Dashboard Load Time**: <3 seconds without errors
- **Functionality**: 100% of existing features working
- **Error Rate**: 0% NumPy compatibility errors
- **Performance**: No degradation in chart rendering
- **Compatibility**: All dependencies stable and documented

## Integration Points

### **System Health Monitoring (US-001)**
- Health dashboard is critical component of US-001
- Fixes enable completion of health monitoring system
- Unblocks real-time system status visibility

### **Development Workflow**
- Enables team to monitor system health during development
- Provides visibility into agent performance
- Supports proactive issue identification

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Dependency Breaking Changes** | Medium | Medium | Test thoroughly, have rollback plan |
| **Performance Degradation** | Low | Low | Benchmark before/after changes |
| **New Compatibility Issues** | Low | Medium | Comprehensive testing across environments |
| **Feature Regression** | Low | High | Full functionality testing |

## Business Value
### **Immediate Value**
- **Restored Functionality**: Health dashboard operational again
- **System Visibility**: Can monitor agent and system health
- **Development Productivity**: Unblocked health monitoring tools
- **Issue Resolution**: Critical bug resolved quickly

### **Long-term Value**
- **System Reliability**: Stable health monitoring foundation
- **Future Compatibility**: Updated dependencies support future development
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Modern, compatible dependency stack
- **Operational Excellence**: Reliable monitoring infrastructure

## Story Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Blocks system health monitoring capabilities
- **QUICK WIN**: Relatively small effort with high impact
- **FOUNDATION**: Enables US-001 health monitoring completion
- **DEPENDENCY**: Required for operational visibility
