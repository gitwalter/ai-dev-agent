## Notes

This document serves as a template for Sprint 1 retrospective and will be populated with actual insights, learnings, and action items during the retrospective meeting at the end of the sprint. The retrospective will focus on establishing effective processes for future sprints and identifying opportunities for continuous improvement in the AI-driven development approach.

### Template Usage
- All TBD items will be replaced with concrete observations and decisions
- Action items will be specific, measurable, and assigned to sprint 2
- Focus will be on systematic process improvement rather than individual performance
- Emphasis on learning and establishing effective practices for future sprints
