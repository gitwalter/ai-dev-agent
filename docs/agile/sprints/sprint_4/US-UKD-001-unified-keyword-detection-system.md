# User Story: US-UKD-001 - Unified Keyword Detection System Implementation

**Epic**: Agent Context Management and Monitoring  
**Sprint**: Sprint 4  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: üîÑ REOPENED - Critical Missing: Real Cursor Conversation Monitoring  

## Story Description

**As a** developer using the AI-Dev-Agent system  
**I want** a unified, YAML-based keyword detection system that triggers context switches and shows real-time agent activity  
**So that** I can see transparent, accurate monitoring of all agent activities and context changes in the live dashboard  

## Background

The current system has scattered, incomplete keyword detection implementations that:
- Use hardcoded keyword mappings instead of the comprehensive YAML configuration
- Show outdated or incorrect "last keyword" information (e.g., showing `@code` when `@agile` was used)
- Don't properly integrate with the agent monitoring dashboard
- Missing critical keywords like `@analyze`
- Have inconsistent behavior across different components

We have a comprehensive `optimized_context_rule_mappings.yaml` configuration that defines all contexts, keywords, and rules, but it's not being used by the detection systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

### üîß Technical Details

**YAML Configuration Structure:**
```yaml
contexts:
  AGILE:
    detection_patterns:
      keywords: ["@agile", "@sprint", "@story", "@backlog"]
    rules:
      foundation: ["ethical_dna_core", "safety_first_principle", ...]
      context: ["agile_coordination"]
      tools: ["project_management_patterns"]
    agent_future: "ScrumMasterAgent"
```

**Key Components:**
- `utils/unified_keyword_detector.py` - Main detection system
- `utils/yaml_based_keyword_detector.py` - YAML loader (deprecated by unified)
- `utils/comprehensive_keyword_detector.py` - Extended mappings (deprecated by unified)
- Integration points in `apps/universal_composition_app.py`

**Expected Context Switches:**
- `@agile` ‚Üí AGILE context ‚Üí 5 agile rules activated
- `@code` ‚Üí CODING context ‚Üí 5 development rules activated  
- `@analyze` ‚Üí ANALYSIS context ‚Üí 5 analysis rules activated
- `@test` ‚Üí TESTING context ‚Üí 5 testing rules activated

## Definition of Done

- [x] **Complete keyword coverage** - All keywords from YAML config supported
- [x] **Unified system integration** - Old detection systems replaced with unified detector
- [ ] **Visible context switches** - Keywords trigger visible changes in agent monitor
- [ ] **Accurate monitoring** - All displayed data reflects real system state

- [ ] **Proper agent lifecycle** - Correct agent counts and status management

## Testing Strategy

### üß™ Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Keyword Detection Test**
   ```
   GIVEN: User types "@agile now the system should show context switch"
   WHEN: Message is processed by unified detector
   THEN: Context switches from DEFAULT to AGILE
   AND: 5 agile rules are activated
   AND: Change is visible in agent monitor immediately
   ```

2. **Multiple Keyword Test**
   ```
   GIVEN: User types "@agile @code @test multiple keywords"
   WHEN: Message is processed
   THEN: All keywords are detected and processed
   AND: Context switches follow priority order
   AND: All rule activations are logged
   ```

3. **Monitor Accuracy Test**
   ```
   GIVEN: Keywords have been used throughout the day
   WHEN: User checks "Complete Agent Activity History"
   THEN: All context switches from today are shown
   AND: No fake or placeholder data is displayed
   AND: "Last keyword" shows the actual last keyword used
   ```

### üî¨ Automated Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for unified keyword detector
- [ ] Integration tests for YAML configuration loading
- [ ] UI tests for agent monitor display
- [ ] Database tests for context switch logging

## Notes and Considerations

### üéØ Context Detection Impact
This story itself was created in response to `@agile` keyword usage, demonstrating the workflow integration working correctly.

### üîó Dependencies
- Requires `optimized_context_rule_mappings.yaml` configuration file
- Depends on universal agent tracker system
- Integrates with main Streamlit application
- Connected to US-TST-002 (test suite fixes)

### üö® Risks
- YAML configuration changes could break detection
- Multiple keyword detection might create conflicts
- Agent lifecycle cleanup could affect active sessions
- Performance impact of real-time processing

### üìä Success Metrics
- Keyword detection accuracy: 100%
- Context switch latency: < 1 second
- Agent monitor refresh time: < 3 seconds
- False positive rate: 0%
- Fake data instances: 0

## Sprint Integration

This story is central to Sprint 4's objectives of improving system transparency and agent monitoring. It directly supports:
