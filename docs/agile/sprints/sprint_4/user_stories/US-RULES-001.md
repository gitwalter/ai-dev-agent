# User Story: Scientific Verification Rule System Implementation

**Story ID**: US-RULES-001  
**Title**: Implement Systematic Scientific Verification Rule System  
**Epic**: EPIC-7 - Formal Principles Excellence
**Sprint**: Sprint 4  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimate**: 8 Story Points  

## Story Description

**As a** development team committed to scientific rigor and evidence-based development  
**I want** a systematic scientific verification rule system that ensures all claims are backed by concrete evidence  
**So that** we eliminate premature success declarations, maintain scientific accuracy, and create reliable, trustworthy development processes  

## Rationale

### **Critical Problem**
Current development suffers from:
- Premature success declarations without evidence
- Marketing language instead of scientific reporting
- Unverified claims about system state and functionality
- Lack of systematic verification protocols
- Inconsistent evidence collection and validation

### **Scientific Foundation**
Following scientific methodology principles:
- **Evidence-Based Claims**: All assertions must be backed by concrete, measurable evidence
- **Systematic Verification**: Formal protocols for validation and testing
- **Reproducible Results**: Verification methods must be repeatable and consistent
- **Failure-First Reporting**: Report failures immediately and completely before any success claims
- **Zero Tolerance**: No exceptions for unverified assertions

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC-1: Core Verification Protocol**
- [ ] **Evidence Collection System**: Systematic collection of execution logs, test results, performance metrics
- [ ] **Verification Commands**: Standardized commands for test execution, health checks, performance validation
- [ ] **Success Criteria Definition**: Clear, measurable criteria defined before starting any task
- [ ] **Evidence Documentation**: Concrete evidence documented for all success claims

### **AC-2: Scientific Reporting Standards**
- [ ] **Failure-First Reporting**: All failures reported immediately and completely
- [ ] **Factual Language Only**: No marketing language, emotional decorations, or subjective assessments
- [ ] **Quantified Measurements**: All claims backed by specific numbers and measurements
- [ ] **Concise Communication**: Progress-relevant information only, optimized for speed and clarity

### **AC-3: Rule System Integration**
- [ ] **Always Active Rule**: Scientific verification rule loaded in every session (`alwaysApply: true`)
- [ ] **Rule Loading Verification**: Confirm rule is actually loaded and enforced
- [ ] **Integration with Existing Rules**: Harmonized with courage rule, boyscout rule, and other core principles
- [ ] **Context-Aware Application**: Rule applies across all development contexts

### **AC-4: Verification Enforcement**
- [ ] **Automatic Validation**: System automatically validates claims against evidence
- [ ] **Violation Detection**: Immediate detection and correction of unverified claims
- [ ] **Evidence Requirements**: Mandatory evidence for all completion and success declarations
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: No progression without proper verification

### **AC-5: Implementation Validation**
- [ ] **Rule Loading Test**: Verify rule is loaded in development sessions
- [ ] **Enforcement Testing**: Test that violations are caught and corrected
- [ ] **Evidence Collection Test**: Validate evidence collection systems work correctly
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Confirm integration with existing development workflow

## Technical Implementation

   - Implement failure-first reporting protocols
   - Establish factual language requirements and validation
   - Create concise communication standards and enforcement

2. **Verification Automation**
   - Implement automatic claim validation against evidence
   - Create violation detection and correction systems
   - Establish quality gates and progression controls

### **Phase 3: Integration and Testing (2 days)**
1. **System Integration**
   - Integrate with existing development workflow and tools
   - Harmonize with other core rules and principles
   - Test cross-rule coordination and enforcement

2. **Validation and Deployment**
   - Comprehensive testing of rule enforcement and evidence collection
   - User acceptance testing with development team
   - Documentation and training on new verification protocols

## Definition of Done
