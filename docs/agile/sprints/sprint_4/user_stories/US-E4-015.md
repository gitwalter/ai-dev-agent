# User Story: US-E4-015 - Fix Fake Default Execution Times in Agent Results

**Epic**: Agent Workflow Excellence  
**Sprint**: Sprint 4  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Status**: Backlog  

## Story Description

**As a** developer using the AI-Dev-Agent system  
**I want** real execution times displayed for each agent in the UI  
**So that** I can accurately monitor agent performance and identify bottlenecks  

## Root Cause Analysis

**Critical Issue Found**: Line 646 in `apps/main.py` contains a fake default execution time:
```python
execution_time=result.get("execution_time", 1.5),  # Default reasonable time
```

This is a lie! The real execution time is calculated in line 335 and should be passed down to individual agents.

## Current Behavior (Broken)
- All agents show execution time of 1.5 seconds in the UI
- This is a hardcoded fake default, not real performance data
- Users cannot identify which agents are slow or fast
- Performance monitoring is completely unreliable

## Expected Behavior (Fixed)
- Each agent displays its actual execution time from the workflow
- Times should vary realistically based on agent complexity
- Performance data should be authentic and actionable
- Zero tolerance for fake defaults

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Remove fake default execution time (1.5s) from line 646
- [ ] Extract real execution time from agent workflow outputs
- [ ] Ensure each agent reports its individual execution time
- [ ] Validate that execution times vary authentically between agents

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test with complex vs simple projects to verify varying execution times
- [ ] Verify execution times are realistic (not all identical)
- [ ] Confirm UI displays real performance data
- [ ] Test that slow agents show higher execution times

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Document the execution time extraction logic
- [ ] Update architecture docs to explain real vs fake data handling
- [ ] Add performance monitoring guide

## Definition of Done
- Real execution times extracted from agent outputs
- UI displays authentic performance data
- All tests pass with real data
- Zero fake defaults in the codebase
- Performance monitoring is reliable and actionable

## Investigation Notes
- Real execution time calculated in `apps/main.py` line 335
- Fake default applied in line 646: `result.get("execution_time", 1.5)`
- Need to investigate what `result.get("execution_time")` actually contains
- Agent outputs structure needs examination to find real timing data

## Technical Debt
This fake default represents a fundamental violation of data integrity. No defaults should be used when real data exists in the system.
