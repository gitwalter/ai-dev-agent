# User Story: US-DEEPAGENTS-003 - HITL + Safety for Sensitive Operations

**Epic**: EPIC-2: Software Development Agents  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Not started  
**Created**: 2025-12-23  
**Assignee**: AI Team  
**Dependencies**: US-DEEPAGENTS-001  

## Story Overview

**As a** developer running agents locally  
**I want** human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive operations (file writes/edits and spawning subagents)  
**So that** we can safely iterate without accidental destructive changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document the recommended HITL policy for DeepAgents usage in this repo
- [ ] Demonstrate how to pause on configured tools and resume with approve/reject decisions
- [ ] Ensure the policy is consistent with project safety rules (no hidden writes, no destructive ops without approval)
