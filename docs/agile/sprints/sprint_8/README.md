# Sprint 8: DeepAgents + MCP Tooling Foundation

**Sprint Goal**: Build a reliable foundation for agents built with the DeepAgents framework and MCP tools, aligned with the working patterns in `tests/deep_agents/deep_agents_mcp.ipynb`.

**Sprint Duration**: 2025-12-23 - 2026-01-06  
**Story Points**: 34 points

## Objectives

1. Establish a clear, repeatable way to run local FastMCP servers and connect to them from clients.
2. Build a baseline DeepAgent that can load MCP tools and use thread-scoped memory.
3. Add a small multi-agent composition pattern (specialists + coordinator) using MCP tools.
4. Add HITL guidance for sensitive operations (file writes/edits and subagent spawning).
