# US-RAG-001: RAG-Enhanced IDE Integration for AI Independence

**Epic**: AI Development Excellence & Independence  
**Sprint**: Current Sprint (Next Available)  
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ HIGH  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Assignee**: RAG Integration Specialist Team  

## ðŸ“‹ **User Story**

**As a** development team using AI assistance in our IDE  
**I want** an integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that learns from our codebase, patterns, and development history  
**So that** the AI assistant becomes truly project-aware, independent, and provides context-specific guidance based on our actual development patterns  

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement**

Currently, AI assistance relies on external memory systems and generic patterns, lacking deep knowledge of:
- Our specific codebase structure (`utils/`, `agents/`, `tests/`)
- Our naming conventions and file organization rules
- Our historical solutions to import errors and platform issues
- Our project-specific patterns and best practices
- Our agile workflows and user story formats

This creates dependency on external systems and reduces AI effectiveness in our specific context.

## ðŸ’¡ **Solution Overview**

Implement a self-contained RAG system that:
1. **Indexes our entire codebase** into a vector database
2. **Learns from our development patterns** (successful imports, error solutions, command patterns)
3. **Integrates with Cursor IDE** (or any IDE) for real-time context retrieval
4. **Provides project-specific guidance** based on actual codebase knowledge
5. **Operates independently** without external dependencies

## ðŸ¤– **EXTENSION: Rules-Triggered Agent Integration**

### **Enhanced Problem Statement**
While RAG provides excellent context retrieval, we need **intelligent action execution** that goes beyond static scripts. Complex development tasks require reasoning, adaptation, and multi-step coordination that simple automation scripts cannot provide.

### **Agent Integration Architecture**

#### **Tier-Based Execution System**
```python
class RuleAgentOrchestrator:
    """Rules trigger appropriate execution tier based on task complexity."""
    
    EXECUTION_TIERS = {
        "simple": {
            "handler": "automation_scripts",
            "examples": ["update_user_story_status", "file_organization"],
            "response_time": "<200ms",
            "reliability": "99.9%"
        },
        "complex": {
            "handler": "custom_agents", 
            "examples": ["analyze_requirements", "fix_systematic_imports"],
            "response_time": "<2s",
            "intelligence": "adaptive_reasoning"
        },
        "advanced": {
            "handler": "langchain_workflows",
            "examples": ["generate_architecture", "multi_agent_collaboration"],
            "response_time": "<10s", 
            "capabilities": "multi_step_reasoning"
        }
    }
```

#### **Context-Triggered Agent Activation**
```yaml
CONTEXT_AGENT_MAP:
  AGILE:
    story_creation: [RequirementsAnalystAgent, UserStoryGeneratorAgent]
    sprint_planning: [SprintPlannerAgent, VelocityAnalystAgent]
    artifact_maintenance: [DocumentationAgent, QualityAssuranceAgent]
    
  TESTING:
    test_generation: [TestGeneratorAgent, QualityAssuranceAgent]
    systematic_fixing: [UnifiedTestDeveloperAgent]
    test_analysis: [TestAnalysisAgent, CoverageAnalystAgent]
    
  ARCHITECTURE:
    design_analysis: [ArchitectureDesignerAgent]
    code_review: [CodeReviewAgent, SecurityAnalystAgent]
    refactoring: [RefactoringAgent, QualityAgent]
