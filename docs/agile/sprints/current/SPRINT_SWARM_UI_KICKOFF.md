### **Key Design Principles**
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
2. **Loose Coupling**: Modules communicate through event bus
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together
4. **No Fake Functionality**: All features are real and working
5. **Professional UI**: Consistent design language throughout

## 🔄 **Migration Strategy**

### **From Universal Composition App**
1. **Feature Audit**: Identify real vs fake functionality in universal app
2. **Data Migration**: Preserve valid configuration and state data
3. **User Training**: Provide training on new modular interface
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Phase out universal app as modules come online
5. **Cleanup**: Remove universal app once migration is complete

### **Integration Points**
- **MCP System**: Direct integration with utils/mcp/ infrastructure
- **RAG System**: Integration with context/context_engine.py
- **Agent Framework**: Integration with agents/ directory
- **Universal Tracker**: Integration with logging and monitoring

## 📊 **Success Metrics & Quality Gates**

### **Code Quality Targets**
- **Module Size**: < 500 lines per module (vs 1070+ in universal app)
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% for all modules
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: < 10 per function
- **Import Dependencies**: < 5 external dependencies per module
- **Code Duplication**: < 5% duplicate code

### **Performance Targets**
- **Module Load Time**: < 2 seconds for module switching
- **UI Responsiveness**: < 100ms for user interactions
- **Memory Usage**: < 1GB RAM under normal load
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for normal operations

### **User Experience Targets**
- **Task Completion Rate**: > 95% success rate
