## üîÑ What Could Be Improved (Action Items)

### 1. Sprint Scope Management üü°
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**What Happened**:
- Originally planned 3-week sprint
- Extended to 4 weeks
- Committed to 65 points, delivered 55

**Why It Happened**:
- Velocity estimate too optimistic (17-20 pts/week)
- Actual velocity was 13.75 pts/week
- New priorities emerged mid-sprint (HITL architecture)

**Action Items for Sprint 7**:
- ‚úÖ Use 24-25 points/week capacity (more conservative)
- ‚úÖ Build in 20% buffer for unknown complexity
- ‚úÖ Review velocity weekly, adjust if needed
- ‚úÖ Be more aggressive about moving items to backlog

**Owner**: Sprint Master  
**Due**: Sprint 7 Planning

---

### 2. MCP Integration Deferral üü°
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**What Happened**:
- Started MCP work but didn't complete
- Shifted focus to HITL architecture mid-sprint
- MCP moved to Sprint 7/backlog

**Why It Happened**:
- User feedback emphasized HITL was more valuable
- Priorities shifted based on user needs
- Good pivot, but left some work incomplete

**Action Items for Sprint 7**:
- ‚úÖ Better stakeholder alignment at sprint start
- ‚úÖ More frequent check-ins on priorities
- ‚úÖ Flag potential pivots earlier
- ‚úÖ Document why priorities changed

**Owner**: Product Owner  
**Due**: Sprint 7 Planning

---

### 3. LangSmith Studio Testing Incomplete üü°
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM

**What Happened**:
- Some LangSmith Studio testing items incomplete
- Studio configuration works but not fully validated
- Some test cases deferred

**Why It Happened**:
- Studio testing requires more time than expected
- Focus shifted to getting core functionality working
- Testing seen as "nice to have" vs. "must have"

**Action Items for Sprint 7**:
- ‚úÖ Dedicate explicit testing phases
- ‚úÖ Use Studio testing as quality gate
- ‚úÖ Don't defer testing to "later"
- ‚úÖ Add testing to Definition of Done

**Owner**: QA / Development Team  
**Due**: Sprint 7 Week 1

---

### 4. Test Coverage for New Agents üü°
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM

**What Happened**:
- Core functionality well-tested
- Some sophisticated agents lack unit tests
- Integration tests good, unit test coverage lower

**Why It Happened**:
- Focus on getting features working
- Unit tests seen as less critical for prototype
- Time pressure led to deferring some tests

**Action Items for Sprint 7**:
- ‚úÖ Write unit tests for all new agents
- ‚úÖ TDD approach: tests first
- ‚úÖ Aim for 95%+ coverage
- ‚úÖ Add test coverage to code review checklist

**Owner**: Development Team  
**Due**: Sprint 7 Ongoing

## üí° Key Insights & Learnings

### 1. Quality Over Features ‚≠ê
**Learning**: The sophisticated 5-agent RAG system delivers far more value than multiple simple features.

**Evidence**: User feedback consistently praised quality of responses from sophisticated system vs. simple retrieval.

**Application**: Sprint 7 will focus on fewer, higher-quality features (HITL architecture) rather than many simple features.

---

### 2. Human-in-Loop is Critical ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Learning**: User feedback strongly emphasized need for human guidance in RAG workflows.

**Evidence**: Users wanted:
- Ability to guide agent decisions
- Review intermediate results
- Provide feedback at multiple points
- Control knowledge sources

**Application**: Sprint 7 is HITL-first - 6 strategic checkpoints for human control.

---

### 3. Flexibility Wins ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Learning**: Ability to adapt sprint priorities based on user needs was valuable.

**Evidence**: Pivot from MCP to HITL mid-sprint was the right call based on user feedback.

**Application**: Sprint 7 will maintain flexibility while staying focused on core goals.

---

### 4. Documentation Pays Off ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Learning**: Comprehensive documentation made handoff and continuation seamless.

**Evidence**: 
- Sprint 6 ‚Üí Sprint 7 transition smooth due to docs
- New context windows had all information needed
- Decisions were traceable and clear

**Application**: Continue excellent documentation discipline in Sprint 7.
