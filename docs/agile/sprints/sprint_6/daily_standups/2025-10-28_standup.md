### 🔄 What We're Working On Today (Oct 28)

#### US-MCP-001: MCP-Enhanced Agent Tool Access (18 points)
**Current Phase**: Week 2 - RAG-MCP Integration  
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGH

**Today's Focus**:
1. **Morning Session**: Review MCP integration architecture
   - Examine existing MCP tools and client setup
   - Validate RAG-specific MCP tools requirement
   - Plan integration with context_engine.py

2. **Afternoon Session**: Begin RAG-MCP integration implementation
   - Create RAG-specific MCP tools for semantic search
   - Implement context analysis tool
   - Design knowledge base integration

**Acceptance Criteria Target**:
- [ ] AC-2.5: RAG-specific MCP tools for semantic search and context analysis
- [ ] AC-2.6: Integration of existing context_engine.py with MCP server
- [ ] AC-2.7: Agent swarm coordination through RAG-enhanced tool selection

#### US-SWARM-002: Final Testing (1 point remaining)
- LangGraph Studio testing validation
- Final acceptance criteria verification
- Story closure and documentation

---

### 🚧 Blockers & Impediments

#### 🟡 Minor Issues
1. **LangSmith Connection**: Runtime testing of prompt sync deferred
   - **Impact**: Low - system designed with fallbacks
   - **Mitigation**: Dry-run mode available for safe testing
   - **Action**: Test when LangSmith connection available

2. **LangGraph Studio Setup**: Need to validate in Studio environment
   - **Impact**: Low - blocking final US-SWARM-002 closure
   - **Mitigation**: Can test incrementally
   - **Action**: Setup Studio environment today

#### ✅ No Critical Blockers
- All major dependencies resolved
- Team has clear path forward
- Implementation proceeding smoothly
