# User Story: US-SWARM-UI-001 - Modular Agent Swarm Management Application

**Epic**: EPIC-0 - Development Excellence


## Epic
**AI Development Excellence & Agent Orchestration**

## Story Overview
**As a** development team and AI system administrators  
**I want** a clean, modular application for agent swarm management with dedicated interfaces for agent building, MCP configuration, RAG management, and comprehensive logging  
**So that** we can efficiently create, configure, and monitor agent swarms without the bloat and fake functionality of the current universal composition app

## Priority
ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL** (Replace bloated universal_composition_app)

## Story Points
**55 points** (4 week implementation - major architectural overhaul)

## Description

The current `universal_composition_app.py` has become a 1070+ line monolithic application with mixed concerns, fake functionality, and poor modularity. This story creates a new, clean, modular application specifically designed for agent swarm management with proper separation of concerns.
