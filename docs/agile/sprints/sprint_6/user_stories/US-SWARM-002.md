**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ High

## Story Description
Implement a true multi-agent swarm architecture using LangChain v1.0 create_agent() pattern.

**Architecture Overview:**
- Each specialist agent (requirements_analyst, code_generator, documentation_generator) is a full ReAct agent with tools
- Supervisor agents (complexity_analyzer, agent_selector, router) coordinate workflow
- State management using TypedDict with Annotated reducers for concurrent writes
- LangSmith integration for centralized prompt management
- Start simple with prompts and state, add tools incrementally

**Implementation Approach:**
Phase 1 (Current): Basic structure with minimal tools
Phase 2 (Future): Add specialized tools per agent  
Phase 3 (Future): Add more specialist agents
Phase 4 (Future): Human-in-the-loop integration

## Business Justification
Enable scalable, maintainable multi-agent architecture that:
- Follows LangChain/LangGraph v1.0 best practices and official documentation
- Allows each agent to operate independently with tools via ReAct pattern
- Provides clean supervisor coordination layer for complex workflows
- Supports incremental tool addition without breaking existing agents
- Leverages LangSmith for prompt versioning and A/B testing
- Creates foundation for future agent additions and swarm evolution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Individual agents created using create_agent() with ReAct pattern per LangChain v1.0 docs âœ…
- [x] Supervisor nodes coordinate workflow using StateGraph âœ…
- [x] State management uses TypedDict with Annotated[List, operator.add] for list accumulation âœ…
- [x] Agent wrapper nodes integrate ReAct agents into supervisor workflow âœ…
- [x] LangSmith PromptLoader successfully loads prompts with fallbacks âœ…
- [x] All agents can be invoked independently and return partial state updates âœ…
- [x] Workflow supports dynamic agent selection based on project complexity âœ…
- [x] Initial implementation works with basic tools (more added incrementally) âœ…
- [x] No linting errors, follows all project coding standards âœ…
- [ ] **Prompt Sync System**: Local fallback copies of all LangSmith prompts maintained automatically
  - Prompts fetched from LangSmith are compared with local versions
  - New/changed prompts automatically saved to local storage (prompts/langsmith_cache/)
  - If LangSmith unavailable, system falls back to local cached versions
  - Version tracking shows last sync timestamp and changes
- [ ] Documentation explains architecture and how to add new agents/tools
- [ ] Works in LangGraph Studio for visualization and debugging (needs testing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] All tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated and accurate
- [ ] Integration testing completed
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security requirements validated
