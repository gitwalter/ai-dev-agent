## 🔄 Carried to Sprint 7

### US-MCP-001: MCP-Enhanced Agent Tool Access (5 of 18 points)

**Reason for Deferral**: Sprint focus shifted to sophisticated RAG system with HITL architecture, which provides more immediate value than MCP integration.

**Completed Work**:
- MCP client infrastructure (`utils/mcp/client.py`)
- Basic MCP tools exploration
- Initial LangGraph Studio configuration

**Remaining Work** (moved to Sprint 7):
- RAG-specific MCP tools
- Agent-MCP coordination
- Complete integration testing

## 📋 Deferred to Backlog

### US-RAG-002: RAG Document Database Integration (8 points)
**Status**: 📋 BACKLOG

**Reason**: Qdrant vector storage is sufficient for current needs. SQLite migration can be deferred until database-specific features are needed.

---

### US-RAG-003: Adaptive RAG Chunk Retrieval (5 points)
**Status**: 📋 BACKLOG

**Reason**: Replaced by more sophisticated multi-agent approach in US-RAG-004. Current retrieval quality is excellent.

---

### US-SEMANTIC-001: Advanced Semantic Search Features (3 points)
**Status**: 📋 BACKLOG

**Reason**: Core semantic search is working well. Advanced features can wait for specific user needs.

---

### US-SWARM-UI-001: Agent Swarm Management UI (5 points)
**Status**: 📋 BACKLOG

**Reason**: RAG management UI is sufficient. Dedicated swarm UI is nice-to-have, not critical.

   - Decision rationale well-documented

### What Could Be Improved 🔄

1. **Sprint Scope Management**
   - **Issue**: Original 3-week sprint extended to 4 weeks
   - **Learning**: Be more conservative with point commitments
   - **Action**: Sprint 7 uses more realistic 24-25 points/week velocity

2. **MCP Integration Deferral**
   - **Issue**: MCP work started but not completed
   - **Learning**: New priorities emerged (HITL) that were more valuable
   - **Action**: Better stakeholder alignment on priorities

3. **Testing in LangSmith Studio**
   - **Issue**: Some testing items incomplete
   - **Learning**: LangSmith Studio testing requires more time
   - **Action**: Dedicate specific testing phases in future sprints

### Key Insights 💡

1. **Quality Over Features**: The sophisticated 5-agent RAG system delivers far more value than multiple simple features

2. **Human-in-Loop is Critical**: User feedback emphasized need for human guidance in RAG workflows - led to Sprint 7 focus

3. **Flexibility Wins**: Ability to adapt sprint priorities (HITL over MCP) based on user needs was valuable

4. **Documentation Pays Off**: Comprehensive docs made handoff and continuation seamless
