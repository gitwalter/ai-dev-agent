# User Story: Repository Disaster Recovery and Repair

**Epic**: EPIC-6 - Full Cursor Automation

**Story ID**: US-REPO-REPAIR-001  
**Sprint**: Sprint 0  
**Priority**: BLOCKER  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Status**: Ready for Development  

## Story Description

As a **Development Team**,  
I want to **recover from the repository damage caused by overly strict file organization**  
So that **we can restore a clean, working development environment and continue productive development**.

## Context and Background

### The Disaster
- **Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Root Cause**: Overly strict file organization automation caused structural damage
- **Impact**: 191 files incorrectly moved, imports broken, development blocked
- **Reference**: [Folder Organization Disaster Report](../lessons_learned/folder_organization_disaster_report.md)

### Current State Analysis
- **Last Good Commit**: `e9bfedb feat: Implement formal rule system with self-optimizing automation`
- **Problematic Commits**: 
  - `9a6266f Apply file organization rule and move files to correct locations with excellence`
  - `1ed4873 Fix folder organization script path construction issues`
  - `462fa33 Reorganize project structure - move files to appropriate locations`
  - `2c01637 Improve folder organization script logging and transparency`

### Proposed Solution
Reset repository to the last known good state (formal rule system commit) and rework subsequent changes manually with proper testing and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
- [ ] **Repository Reset**: Successfully reset to commit `e9bfedb` (formal rule system implementation)
- [ ] **Clean Working Directory**: No uncommitted changes or conflicts after reset
- [ ] **Functional Imports**: All Python imports work correctly
- [ ] **Test Suite Passing**: All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] **Development Environment**: Team can continue development immediately

### Secondary Success Criteria
- [ ] **Backup Creation**: Complete backup of current state before reset
- [ ] **Change Documentation**: Document what changes were lost and need rework
- [ ] **Recovery Plan**: Create plan for reworking lost improvements
- [ ] **Prevention Measures**: Implement safeguards against future automation disasters

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Git Status Clean**: `git status` shows clean working directory
- [ ] **Import Validation**: All Python modules can be imported without errors
- [ ] **Test Execution**: `python -m pytest tests/` passes completely
- [ ] **Documentation Integrity**: All documentation links and references work
- [ ] **Rule System Integrity**: Formal rule system remains functional

## Technical Requirements

### Repository Reset Process
1. **Backup Current State**
   ```bash
   git branch backup-before-reset-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   git tag disaster-recovery-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   ```

2. **Reset to Good Commit**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard e9bfedb
   git clean -fd
   ```

3. **Verify Reset Success**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   git status
   ```

### Validation Steps
1. **Import Testing**
   ```python
   # Test all major modules
   python -c "import utils; print('Utils OK')"
   python -c "import agents; print('Agents OK')"
   python -c "import workflow; print('Workflow OK')"
   ```

2. **Test Suite Execution**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
   ```

3. **Documentation Validation**
   ```bash
   # Check for broken links and references
   find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\[.*\]" {} \;
   ```

### Recovery Documentation
- **Lost Changes Inventory**: Document what improvements were lost
- **Rework Priority List**: Prioritize which changes to rework first
- **Manual Implementation Plan**: Plan for manual rework of lost improvements

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Data Loss**: Potential loss of recent improvements and fixes
- **Team Productivity**: Temporary development halt during recovery
- **Trust Impact**: Reduced confidence in automation tools

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Complete Backup**: Preserve all current work in backup branches
- **Incremental Recovery**: Recover changes in priority order
- **Manual Validation**: Test each recovered change thoroughly

### Rollback Plan
- **Immediate Rollback**: If reset fails, restore from backup branch
- **Alternative Approach**: If reset approach fails, manual file restoration
- **Emergency Recovery**: Last resort - fresh clone and selective file restoration

## Definition of Done
