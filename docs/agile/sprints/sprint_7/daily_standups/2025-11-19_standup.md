### 🔄 What We're Working On Today

#### 🎯 PRIMARY FOCUS: Fix Complex RAG Workflow Issues

**Problem Identified**: Complex RAG workflow has issues that need fixing

**Key Questions to Address**:
1. What specific errors or failures are occurring?
2. Is the workflow executing correctly through all agents?
3. Are there routing issues between nodes?
4. Are HITL checkpoints interrupting correctly?
5. Is state management working properly?

**Today's Investigation Tasks**:
1. **Identify Specific Issues**: 
   - Test current RAG workflow execution
   - Document any errors or failures
   - Check LangSmith traces for issues
   
2. **Analyze Root Causes**:
   - Review graph structure and routing logic
   - Check agent node implementations
   - Verify state management and checkpointer
   
3. **Prioritize Fixes**:
   - Determine which issues block progress most
   - Create fix plan based on priority
   - Estimate effort for fixes

### 🚧 Blockers & Impediments

#### 🔴 Critical Blockers

1. **Complex RAG Workflow Issues** (NEW - TODAY'S FOCUS)
   - **Impact**: HIGH - Blocks US-RAG-005 Phase 3 testing
   - **Impact**: HIGH - Blocks US-RAG-006 Phase 5 end-to-end testing
   - **Status**: Needs investigation and diagnosis
   - **Action**: Investigate today, fix based on findings

#### 🟡 Minor Issues

1. **LangSmith Trace Validation**: Need to verify tracing works correctly
   - **Impact**: Medium - blocks validation but not core functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Can test locally first

2. **UI Integration**: HITL feedback UI not yet integrated
   - **Impact**: Medium - blocks full HITL workflow testing
   - **Mitigation**: Can test workflow without UI first

## 💡 Discussion Points

### What Should We Do Today?

**Option 1: Deep Investigation** (Recommended)
- Thoroughly test RAG workflow
- Document all issues found
- Create comprehensive fix plan
- **Benefit**: Clear understanding before fixing

**Option 2: Quick Fixes**
- Fix obvious issues immediately
- Test incrementally
- **Risk**: May miss root causes
