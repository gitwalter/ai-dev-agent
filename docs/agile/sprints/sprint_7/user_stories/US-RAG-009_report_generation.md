# US-RAG-009: Report Generation from RAG

**Epic**: RAG System Enhancement  
**Story ID**: US-RAG-009  
**Priority**: Low (future vision)  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Sprint**: Future (Sprint 9+)  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Backlog  

---

## User Story

**As a** development team lead / product manager  
**I want** RAG to generate structured reports instead of just answering questions  
**So that** I can make high-leverage decisions based on comprehensive analysis

---

## Business Value

**Problem**: Current RAG = Q&A system
- Value = time saved (1-dimensional)
- Hard to sell beyond wage savings
- No decision-making support
- Output format unclear

**Solution**: Shift to report generation
- Reports = decision-making tools
- Value = % of high-leverage outcomes
- Structured outputs (SOPs)
- Multi-dimensional value

**Value Examples**:

| Use Case | Q&A Value | Report Value |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Research | $400/hr saved | Enable $5M budget decision |
| Hiring | Interview notes | $40k recruiter value on $250k hire |
| Architecture | Answer questions | $20k strategic decision doc |
| Code Review | Review comments | Standardized review template |

## Technical Implementation

### Report Generation Pipeline

```python
class ReportGenerator:
    """Generate structured reports from RAG retrieval."""
    
    def generate_report(self, template: ReportTemplate, context: Dict) -> Report:
        """
        Multi-step report generation.
        
        Args:
            template: SOP template to use
            context: Input data (transcripts, docs, etc.)
        
        Returns:
            Structured report following template
        """
        # Step 1: Decompose into sub-questions
        questions = self._decompose_template(template)
        
        # Step 2: RAG retrieval for each section
        sections = {}
        for section, question in questions.items():
            # Use our RAG system to gather context
            rag_result = self.rag_agent.invoke(
                query=question,
                context=context
            )
            sections[section] = rag_result['response']
        
        # Step 3: Synthesize into report
        report = self._synthesize_report(template, sections)
        
        # Step 4: Apply formatting
        formatted = self._apply_template_formatting(report, template)
        
        return formatted
```

### Report Templates

```python
class SprintRetrospectiveTemplate(ReportTemplate):
    """Template for sprint retrospective reports."""
    
    sections = {
        'summary': 'What was accomplished this sprint?',
        'what_went_well': 'What went well during the sprint?',
        'what_to_improve': 'What should we improve for next sprint?',
        'action_items': 'What are the concrete action items?',
        'metrics': 'What were the sprint metrics (velocity, completion rate)?'
    }
    
    def format(self, sections: Dict[str, str]) -> str:
        """Format sections into final report."""
        return f"""
# Sprint Retrospective Report
Date: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}

## Sprint Summary
{sections['summary']}

## What Went Well âœ…
{sections['what_went_well']}

## Areas for Improvement ðŸŽ¯
{sections['what_to_improve']}

## Action Items ðŸ“‹
{sections['action_items']}

## Sprint Metrics ðŸ“Š
{sections['metrics']}
"""

class ArchitectureDecisionTemplate(ReportTemplate):
    """Template for Architecture Decision Records."""
    
    sections = {
        'context': 'What is the context and problem being addressed?',
        'decision': 'What architectural decision was made?',
        'consequences': 'What are the consequences of this decision?',
        'alternatives': 'What alternatives were considered?',
        'status': 'What is the status? (proposed/accepted/deprecated)'
    }
    
    def format(self, sections: Dict[str, str]) -> str:
        """Format ADR following standard format."""
        return f"""
# ADR: {sections.get('title', 'Architecture Decision')}

**Status**: {sections['status']}  
**Date**: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}

## Context
{sections['context']}

## Decision
{sections['decision']}

## Consequences
{sections['consequences']}

## Alternatives Considered
{sections['alternatives']}
"""
```

### Integration with Streamlit

```python
# In Streamlit app
if st.button("Generate Sprint Retrospective"):
    with st.spinner("Generating report from meeting transcripts..."):
        # Gather context
        context = {
            'meeting_transcripts': load_meeting_transcripts(sprint_id),
            'chat_logs': load_chat_logs(sprint_id),
            'completed_stories': load_completed_stories(sprint_id)
        }
        
        # Generate report
        report_gen = ReportGenerator(rag_agent)
        report = report_gen.generate_report(
            template=SprintRetrospectiveTemplate(),
            context=context
        )
        
        # Display and save
        st.markdown(report.content)
        
        if st.button("Save to Agile Artifacts"):
            save_path = f"docs/agile/sprints/sprint_{sprint_id}/retrospective.md"
            report.save(save_path)
            st.success(f"Saved to {save_path}")
```

## Success Metrics

### Value Metrics
- **Decision velocity**: Time from data â†’ decision reduced
- **Decision quality**: Better outcomes from structured reports
- **Resource allocation**: Improved budget/time allocation
- **Template reuse**: Same SOP used across teams

### Usage Metrics
- Reports generated per week
- Template effectiveness scores
- Human edit % (lower = better template)
- Report â†’ decision conversion rate

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Sprint Retrospective
**Input**: 5 meeting transcripts, 100+ chat messages, 12 completed stories  
**Output**: Structured retrospective with:
- Summary of sprint accomplishments
- 3-5 items that went well
- 3-5 areas for improvement
- 5-7 concrete action items
- Sprint metrics dashboard

**Value**: Enables better sprint planning, clear action items, improved team alignment

### Example 2: Architecture Decision
**Input**: Design discussion thread, code context, alternatives analysis  
**Output**: ADR document with:
- Problem context
- Chosen solution
- Consequences and trade-offs
- Rejected alternatives and why

**Value**: Permanent decision record, onboarding aid, prevents re-litigating decisions

---

## Dependencies

- **Requires**: US-RAG-006 Phase 2 (AgenticRAG working)
- **Nice to have**: US-RAG-008 (synthetic data for testing templates)
- **Integration**: Agile artifacts directory structure
- **Tools**: Template engine, markdown formatting

---

## Open Questions

1. Which report types provide most value? (Start with retro, ADR, code review)
2. How much human editing is acceptable? (Target: <20% edit required)
3. Auto-save to agile artifacts or require approval? (Suggest: require approval)
4. Template versioning strategy? (Suggest: Git-based)

---

## Notes

- Reports are **decision-making tools**, not just summaries
- Value is **% of high-leverage outcome**, not time saved
- SOPs (templates) are valuable intellectual property
- Focus on **structured outputs** following proven formats
- This shifts RAG from Q&A to **strategic tool**

**This is the future direction of RAG** - from answering questions to enabling decisions.
