## ðŸš§ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Complex HITL Implementation
**Impact**: High | **Probability**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Implement incrementally, test each checkpoint independently

### Risk 2: State Management Complexity
**Impact**: High | **Probability**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Use LangGraph's built-in checkpointing, comprehensive testing

### Risk 3: Performance with Full Pipeline
**Impact**: Medium | **Probability**: Low  
**Mitigation**: Mode selection allows users to choose speed vs. quality, caching

### Risk 4: Task Classification Accuracy
**Impact**: Medium | **Probability**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Manual override option, learning from user corrections
