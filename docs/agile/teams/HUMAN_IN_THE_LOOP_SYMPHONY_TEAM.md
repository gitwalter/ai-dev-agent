#### **💬 Chat with Agents**
```python
class HumanAgentChat:
    """Real-time conversational interface for human-agent interaction."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversation_state = ConversationStateManager()
        self.websocket_handler = RealTimeWebSocket()
        self.agent_coordinator = AgentConversationCoordinator()
        
    async def start_conversation(self, agent_name: str, context: Dict):
        """Initiate conversation with specific agent about workflow step."""
        
    async def send_human_message(self, message: str, attachments: List = None):
        """Send human message with optional attachments/context."""
        
    async def receive_agent_response(self, agent_response: Dict):
        """Process and display agent response with rich formatting."""
```

#### **✋ Pause/Resume Workflow**
```python
class WorkflowPauseManager:
    """Manage workflow execution pausing and resuming."""
    
    async def inject_approval_gate(self, workflow_step: WorkflowStep):
        """Inject human approval requirement into workflow step."""
        
    async def pause_for_review(self, current_state: Dict, reason: str):
        """Pause workflow and present current state for review."""
        
    async def resume_with_approval(self, approval_data: Dict):
        """Resume workflow execution with human approval/modifications."""
```

#### **📝 Provide Feedback & 🔄 Request Revisions**
```python
class FeedbackRevisionSystem:
    """Handle human feedback and revision requests."""
    
    async def collect_feedback(self, work_item: Any, feedback_type: str):
        """Collect structured feedback on agent work."""
        
    async def request_revision(self, agent_name: str, revision_request: Dict):
        """Send revision request to agent with specific guidance."""
        
    async def apply_feedback_to_workflow(self, feedback: Dict):
        """Apply human feedback to modify ongoing workflow."""
```

## 🎵 **The Maestro's Vision**

*"We create not just software, but symphonies of human-AI collaboration. Every interaction should feel like a conversation with a brilliant colleague who happens to be an AI. Every approval gate should feel like a natural pause for reflection, not an interruption. Every revision should feel like creative collaboration, not correction."*

**Our symphony will demonstrate that the future of software development is not about replacing humans with AI, but about creating beautiful harmony between human creativity and AI capability.**
