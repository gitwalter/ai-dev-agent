# How to Work with @agile - Developer's Practical Guide
====================================================

**Created**: 2025-09-01  
**Priority**: ESSENTIAL - Developer Success  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step practical guide for developers and teams  
**Context**: Love, harmony, and growth through agile mastery  

## 🎯 **Quick Start - Get Productive in 10 Minutes**

### **🆕 Automatic User Story Creation (NEW!)**
**The system now automatically creates user stories when you start development work!**

```bash
# Just start working naturally - stories are created automatically:
"Implement a health monitoring dashboard with real-time alerts"

# The AI automatically detects this needs a story and:
# ✅ Analyzes work complexity (dashboard = 6/10 complexity)
# ✅ Creates user story: "Feature: Implement health monitoring dashboard"
# ✅ Generates acceptance criteria with TDD integration
# ✅ Estimates story points (6 points for this complexity)
# ✅ Assigns to current sprint
# ✅ Updates all agile artifacts automatically
# ✅ Applies context-aware rules (CODING context detected)

# You get immediate feedback:
# 📋 Auto-Created User Story: US-042 - Feature: Implement health monitoring dashboard
# 🎯 Story Points: 6, Priority: HIGH, Type: feature
# 💡 Reasoning: High complexity (6/10) requires story tracking
```

### **Step 1: Your First Agile Project (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Simply type this and watch the magic happen:
@agile create project "My First Agile Project"

# The AI will automatically:
# ✅ Staff a complete expert agile team
# ✅ Set up project structure
# ✅ Create initial backlog
# ✅ Establish sprint planning
# ✅ Configure quality gates
# ✅ Set up stakeholder communication
# ✅ Enable automatic story creation for all development work
```

### **Step 2: Automatic Story Creation (ZERO EFFORT!)**
```bash
# No manual story creation needed! Just start development:
"Fix the authentication bug in user login"
"Add search functionality to the product catalog"
"Refactor the database connection pooling"

# Each request automatically:
# ✅ Gets analyzed for complexity and impact
# ✅ Creates stories for significant work (complexity >= 5)
# ✅ Skips stories for simple tasks (like typo fixes)
# ✅ Applies context-aware rules (6-10 rules vs 39 rules)
# ✅ Updates all agile documentation automatically
# ✅ Tracks progress in real-time
```

### **Step 3: Start Your First Sprint (3 minutes)**
```bash
# Plan and start your sprint:
@agile plan sprint "Sprint 1 - User Authentication"

# The AI will automatically:
# ✅ Analyze team capacity
# ✅ Select appropriate stories
# ✅ Create sprint goals
# ✅ Set up tracking and monitoring
# ✅ Schedule sprint ceremonies
```

### **Step 4: Develop with Agile Support (3 minutes)**
```bash
# Start working on your story:
@agile start story "login functionality"

# The AI will automatically:
# ✅ Create feature branch
# ✅ Set up development environment
# ✅ Provide implementation guidance
# ✅ Monitor progress
# ✅ Apply quality checks
```

**🎉 Congratulations! You're now working in a fully managed agile environment!**

## 📋 **Daily Developer Workflow**

### **Morning Routine (90 seconds)**
```bash
# Start your development day:
@agile morning standup

# You'll automatically get:
# 📊 Today's sprint goals and priorities
# 📝 Your assigned stories and tasks
# 🚨 Any blockers or dependencies
# 🎯 Focus recommendations for maximum productivity
# 📈 Sprint progress and team velocity
```

**Example Output:**
```
🌅 Good morning! Here's your agile day plan:

📊 SPRINT PROGRESS: Day 3 of 10 | 32% Complete | On Track
🎯 TODAY'S FOCUS: Complete user authentication story (US-001)

📝 YOUR ACTIVE STORIES:
  • US-001: User Login (In Progress) - 70% complete
  • US-002: Password Reset (Ready) - Next up after US-001

🚨 NO BLOCKERS: All dependencies resolved ✅

💡 RECOMMENDATION: Focus 2-3 hours on login validation tests
```

### **During Development - Now Fully Automated!**
```bash
# 🆕 AUTOMATIC STORY CREATION: Just describe your work naturally!
"Implement OAuth integration with Google and GitHub providers"
# ↳ Auto-creates: US-055 - Integration: OAuth provider integration (8 points)

"Fix the memory leak in the data processing pipeline" 
# ↳ Auto-creates: US-056 - Technical: Fix memory leak in pipeline (5 points)

"Add user profile picture upload functionality"
# ↳ Auto-creates: US-057 - Feature: User profile picture upload (3 points)

# 🎯 CONTEXT-AWARE AUTOMATION:
# • Detects @code, @debug, @architecture keywords for explicit context
# • Auto-detects context from files, directory, and request content
# • Applies only relevant rules (6-10 rules vs 39 rules = 80% efficiency)
# • Creates stories only for significant work (complexity >= 5)

# Manual controls still available when needed:
@agile help with "implementing OAuth authentication"
@agile prepare code review for US-001
@agile update progress "completed login form validation"
@agile report blocker "third-party API documentation unclear"
```

### **End of Day (60 seconds)**
```bash
# Wrap up your development day:
@agile end of day summary

# You'll automatically get:
# 📈 Progress made today
# 📝 Updated story status
# 🎯 Tomorrow's priorities
# 📊 Sprint health check
# 💌 Stakeholder updates sent
```

## 🤖 **NEW: Automatic User Story Creation System**

### **How It Works**
The system automatically detects when your development work needs a user story and creates it seamlessly:

#### **🔍 Smart Detection Criteria**
```yaml
Automatic Story Creation Triggers:
  complexity_threshold: 5/10  # Work estimated at 3+ days
  feature_keywords: ["implement", "create", "build", "add feature", "new functionality"]
  significant_changes: ["refactor", "restructure", "overhaul", "major fix"]
  integration_work: ["integrate", "connect", "api", "service", "external"]
  user_facing_changes: ["ui", "dashboard", "interface", "visualization"]
  multi_file_impact: "Changes affecting 3+ files"
```

#### **🎯 Context-Aware Intelligence**
```bash
# Explicit context control:
@code "Implement user authentication"     → CODING context, auto-story creation
@debug "Fix memory leak in processor"     → DEBUGGING context, story only if complex
@architecture "Design microservices"      → ARCHITECTURE context, always creates story

# Automatic context detection:
"Create React dashboard component"        → Detects CODING + UI → Auto-creates story
"Write unit tests for auth module"       → Detects TESTING → No story (part of other work)
"Update API documentation"               → Detects DOCUMENTATION → No story (supporting work)
```

#### **⚡ Efficiency Benefits**
- **75-85% Rule Reduction**: Only 6-10 relevant rules loaded per session vs 39 total
- **Zero Manual Overhead**: Stories created automatically, no workflow interruption  
- **Perfect Traceability**: All significant work automatically tracked
- **Context Intelligence**: System understands your intent and applies appropriate automation

#### **🛠 User Control & Preferences**
```bash
# Configure automation behavior:
user_preferences = {
    "auto_create_stories": True,           # Enable/disable automation
    "complexity_threshold": 5,             # Adjust sensitivity (1-10)
    "preferred_contexts": ["CODING", "ARCHITECTURE"],  # Contexts you work in
    "notification_level": "summary"        # How much detail in notifications
}

# Context-specific settings:
CODING: auto_create=True, threshold=4     # Create stories for most development
DEBUGGING: auto_create=False, threshold=6 # Only for major debugging efforts  
TESTING: auto_create=False, threshold=5   # Usually part of other stories
DOCUMENTATION: auto_create=False          # Supporting work, no stories needed
```

#### **📊 Real-World Examples**

| Development Request | Complexity | Context | Story Created? | Reasoning |
|-------------------|------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| "Implement OAuth with Google/GitHub" | 8/10 | CODING | ✅ YES | High complexity feature |
| "Fix typo in error message" | 1/10 | CODING | ❌ NO | Simple maintenance |
| "Design microservices architecture" | 9/10 | ARCHITECTURE | ✅ YES | Major design work |
| "Add unit tests for login function" | 3/10 | TESTING | ❌ NO | Part of existing story |
| "Create health monitoring dashboard" | 7/10 | CODING | ✅ YES | Complex UI development |
