**Story ID**: US-PHIL-001  
**Title**: Philosophical Foundations for Absolute Logical Rule Organization  
**Epic**: EPIC-7 - Formal Principles Excellence
**Priority**: Strategic  
**Estimate**: 21 Story Points  
**Status**: Backlog (Future Sprint)  

## Story Description

**As a** development system committed to absolute logical rigor and philosophical excellence  
**I want** to reorganize our entire rule system based on the foundational principles of philosophical giants (Russell, Carnap, Gödel, Hilbert, Wittgenstein, Quine)  
**So that** we achieve mathematically precise, logically consistent, and ontologically sound rule organization that maximizes expressiveness while maintaining philosophical separation between software and philosophy
