# US-AUTO-001: Full Cursor Automation with Workflow Composition

**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Story Points**: 21 | **Sprint**: Next | **Status**: 📋 **PLANNED**

## User Story
- **As a** developer working on complex software projects
- **I want** an intelligent automation system that composes different @keywords/roles/perspectives in useful sequences for assigned tasks
- **So that** I can execute complete development workflows automatically with minimal manual intervention while maintaining high quality and process adherence

## Problem Statement
Currently, developers must manually orchestrate different development contexts (@code, @test, @debug, @docs, @git, etc.) for complex tasks. This requires:
- Manual context switching between different roles/perspectives
- Remembering optimal sequences for different types of work
- Coordinating multiple development activities across contexts
- Ensuring all necessary steps are completed in the right order
- Managing handoffs between different development phases

We need an intelligent automation system that can automatically compose and execute multi-context workflows for complete task automation.

## Vision Statement
Create a comprehensive automation system that transforms single-task requests into complete, multi-phase development workflows by intelligently composing different contexts, roles, and perspectives in optimal sequences.

## Solution Overview
Implement a **Workflow Composition Engine** that:
1. **Analyzes task requirements** to determine needed contexts and sequence
2. **Composes optimal workflows** using available @keywords/roles/perspectives  
3. **Executes automated sequences** with intelligent handoffs between contexts
4. **Monitors and adapts** workflows based on results and feedback
5. **Provides transparency** into workflow execution and decision-making
