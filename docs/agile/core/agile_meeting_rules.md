# Agile Meeting Rules for AI-Dev-Agent System

**CRITICAL**: These rules ensure all agile meetings are conducted efficiently, effectively, and consistently to maximize team velocity and deliver value.

## üéØ **Universal Meeting Principles**

### **Core Meeting Requirements**
**MANDATORY**: All agile meetings must follow these fundamental principles:

1. **Time-Boxed**: All meetings have strict time limits and must end on time
2. **Purpose-Driven**: Every meeting has clear objectives and desired outcomes
3. **Prepared**: All participants come prepared with necessary information
4. **Facilitated**: Every meeting has a designated facilitator
5. **Documented**: All decisions and action items are recorded and shared
6. **Action-Oriented**: Every meeting produces concrete action items
7. **Value-Focused**: All meetings focus on delivering user and business value

### **Meeting Quality Standards**
```python
# REQUIRED: Meeting effectiveness validation
def validate_meeting_effectiveness(meeting_data: dict) -> bool:
    """Validate that meeting meets agile standards."""
    required_criteria = [
        meeting_data.get("duration_minutes") <= meeting_data.get("timebox_minutes"),
        len(meeting_data.get("action_items", [])) > 0,
        meeting_data.get("facilitator") is not None,
        meeting_data.get("objectives_met", 0) >= 80,  # 80% objectives met
        meeting_data.get("participant_engagement", 0) >= 7  # 7/10 engagement
    ]
    return all(required_criteria)
```

## üìÖ **1. DAILY STANDUP RULES**

### **Meeting Configuration**
- **Duration**: 15 minutes (STRICT)
- **Frequency**: Every working day
- **Time**: Same time daily (recommend 9:00 AM)
- **Facilitator**: Rotating team member or Scrum Master
- **Participants**: All sprint team members

### **Meeting Rules**
**MANDATORY**: Every daily standup must follow these rules:

1. **Three Questions Format**:
   - What did I complete yesterday?
   - What will I work on today?
   - What blockers or impediments do I have?

2. **Sprint Goal Focus**:
   - All updates must relate to sprint goal
   - Identify how today's work advances sprint goal
   - Flag any work not aligned with sprint goal

3. **No Problem Solving**:
   - Identify problems, don't solve them in standup
   - Schedule separate meetings for detailed discussions
   - Park detailed technical discussions

4. **Visual Management**:
   - Update sprint board during standup
   - Show burndown chart progress
   - Highlight blocked items visually

### **Pre-Meeting Automation**
```python
# REQUIRED: Automated standup preparation
def prepare_daily_standup():
    """Automate standup preparation."""
    preparation_data = {
        "burndown_update": update_burndown_chart(),
        "board_sync": synchronize_sprint_board(),
        "blocker_analysis": identify_potential_blockers(),
        "velocity_tracking": calculate_current_velocity(),
        "goal_progress": assess_sprint_goal_progress()
    }
    return preparation_data
```

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Meeting completed within 15 minutes
- [ ] All team members provide updates
- [ ] Sprint goal progress assessed
- [ ] Blockers identified and escalated
- [ ] Next day's work clarity achieved
- [ ] Team synchronization maintained

### **Post-Meeting Actions**
```python
# REQUIRED: Post-standup automation
def post_standup_actions(standup_data: dict):
    """Automate post-standup follow-up."""
    actions = [
        escalate_blockers(standup_data["blockers"]),
        update_stakeholder_dashboard(standup_data["progress"]),
        schedule_problem_solving_sessions(standup_data["parking_lot"]),
        send_daily_summary(standup_data["summary"]),
