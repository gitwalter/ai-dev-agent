## âš¡ **RULE ACTIVATION TRIGGERS**

### **Automatic Rule Activation**
```python
# REQUIRED: Rule activation automation
class AgileRuleActivation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rule_engine = AgileRuleEngine()
        self.meeting_scheduler = MeetingScheduler()
        self.compliance_monitor = ComplianceMonitor()
    
    def activate_rules_for_event(self, event_type: str):

    compliance_metrics = {
        "meeting_rules": {
            "daily_standup": calculate_standup_compliance(),
            "sprint_planning": calculate_planning_compliance(), 
            "sprint_review": calculate_review_compliance(),
            "retrospective": calculate_retro_compliance()
        },
        "development_rules": {
            "tdd_compliance": calculate_tdd_compliance(),
            "ci_cd_compliance": calculate_cicd_compliance(),
            "quality_compliance": calculate_quality_compliance()
        },
        "overall_compliance": calculate_overall_compliance()
    }
    return compliance_metrics
```

### **Target Compliance Levels**

## ðŸ”„ **RULE EVOLUTION PROCESS**

### **Rule Lifecycle Management**
```python
# REQUIRED: Rule lifecycle automation
class AgileRuleLifecycle:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rule_repository = AgileRuleRepository()
        self.effectiveness_analyzer = RuleEffectivenessAnalyzer()
        self.change_manager = RuleChangeManager()
    
    def manage_rule_evolution(self):
        """Continuously evolve rules based on effectiveness data."""
        evolution_cycle = [
            self.measure_rule_effectiveness(),
            self.identify_improvement_opportunities(),
            self.propose_rule_changes(),
            self.validate_rule_changes(),
            self.implement_rule_updates(),
            self.monitor_change_impact()
        ]
        return self.execute_evolution_cycle(evolution_cycle)
```

### **Rule Change Process**
1. **Identify Need**: Performance data or team feedback indicates improvement opportunity
2. **Propose Change**: Draft new or modified rule with rationale
3. **Team Review**: Team validates proposed change and impact
4. **Pilot Test**: Test rule change in controlled environment
5. **Measure Impact**: Assess effectiveness of rule change
6. **Full Implementation**: Roll out successful rule changes
7. **Documentation Update**: Update all relevant documentation

### **Change Approval Matrix**
| Change Type | Approval Required | Testing Required | Documentation Update |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------- |
| **Minor Update** | Team Consensus | 1 Sprint Pilot | Rule Doc Update |
| **Major Change** | Stakeholder + Team | 2 Sprint Pilot | Full Doc Review |
| **New Rule** | All Stakeholders | 3 Sprint Pilot | Complete Integration |
| **Rule Removal** | All Stakeholders | Impact Assessment | Archive Documentation |
