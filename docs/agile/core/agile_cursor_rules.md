# Agile Cursor Rules for AI-Dev-Agent System

## üéØ **Agile Development Principles**

These Cursor rules are specifically designed to enforce agile principles, automate agile processes, and ensure the system operates with maximum agility and efficiency.

---

## üöÄ **TIER 1: CRITICAL AGILE RULES (Always Apply)**

### **Rule 1: Sprint-Focused Development**
**CRITICAL**: All development must align with current sprint goals and deliver working software incrementally.

#### **Core Requirements**
- **Sprint Goal Alignment**: Every task must contribute to the current sprint goal
- **Working Software Priority**: Focus on deliverable, functional increments over comprehensive documentation
- **User Story Completion**: Complete entire user stories, not just technical tasks
- **Sprint Boundary Respect**: No scope creep within sprint boundaries

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python
# CORRECT: Sprint-focused development
def implement_user_story(story_id: str, sprint_goal: str):
    """Implement complete user story aligned with sprint goal."""
    # 1. Validate story aligns with sprint goal
    # 2. Implement minimum viable functionality
    # 3. Ensure story meets definition of done
    # 4. Deliver working software increment
    pass

# INCORRECT: Task-focused development ignoring sprint goals
def implement_technical_task(task_id: str):
    """Implement isolated technical task."""
    # This violates sprint-focused development
    pass
```

#### **Agile Automation**
- Automatic sprint goal validation for all tasks
- Working software validation before task completion
- Sprint boundary enforcement through automated checks
- User story completion tracking and validation

---

### **Rule 2: Continuous Integration & Delivery**
**CRITICAL**: All code must be continuously integrated with automated testing and deployment pipelines.

#### **Core Requirements**
- **Immediate Integration**: Code integrates within minutes of commit
- **Automated Testing**: 100% automated testing with no manual intervention
- **Deployment Readiness**: Every commit is potentially deployable
- **Rapid Feedback**: Feedback loops under 10 minutes

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python
# CORRECT: CI/CD-ready development
def develop_feature(feature_spec: dict):
    """Develop feature with full CI/CD integration."""
    # 1. Write tests first (TDD)
    # 2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
    # 3. Automated integration testing
    # 4. Automated deployment validation
    pass

# INCORRECT: Manual integration development
def develop_feature_manual(feature_spec: dict):
    """Develop feature requiring manual testing."""
    # This violates continuous integration principles
    pass
```

#### **Automation Requirements**
- Automatic test execution on every commit
- Automated deployment pipeline with rollback capability
- Automated quality gates and validation
- Continuous monitoring and alerting

---

### **Rule 3: Customer Collaboration & Feedback**
**CRITICAL**: Prioritize customer collaboration, feedback integration, and user value delivery.

#### **Core Requirements**
- **User Story Driven**: All development based on user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Regular stakeholder demos and feedback collection
- **Value Delivery**: Measure and optimize for user value, not technical metrics
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust plans based on feedback and changing requirements

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python
# CORRECT: Customer-centric development
def implement_user_story(story: UserStory):
    """Implement user story with customer value focus."""
    # 1. Validate user value and acceptance criteria
    # 2. Implement user-facing functionality first
    # 3. Collect stakeholder feedback early
    # 4. Adapt based on feedback
    pass

# INCORRECT: Technology-centric development
def implement_technical_feature(tech_spec: dict):
    """Implement technology feature without user context."""
    # This violates customer collaboration principles
    pass
```

#### **Collaboration Automation**
- Automated stakeholder demo generation
- Feedback collection and integration pipelines
- User value metrics tracking and optimization
- Adaptive planning based on feedback analysis

---

## üèÉ **TIER 2: HIGH-PRIORITY AGILE RULES**

### **Rule 4: Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
**HIGH**: Use TDD cycles (Red-Green-Refactor) for all development with automated test validation.

#### **Core Requirements**
- **Red Phase**: Write failing tests first for all new functionality
- **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
- **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage
- **Automated Validation**: Automated enforcement of TDD cycles

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python
# CORRECT: TDD implementation
def implement_tdd_cycle(requirement: str):
    """Implement requirement using TDD cycle."""
    # RED: Write failing test
    test = create_failing_test(requirement)
    assert test.run() == False
    
    # GREEN: Implement minimal code
    code = implement_minimal_solution(requirement)
    assert test.run() == True
    
    # REFACTOR: Improve code quality
    refactored_code = refactor_for_quality(code)
    assert test.run() == True
    return refactored_code

# INCORRECT: Code-first development
def implement_code_first(requirement: str):
    """Implement code without tests first."""
    # This violates TDD principles
    pass
```

#### **TDD Automation**
- Automatic TDD cycle enforcement
- Test-first validation for all commits
- Automated refactoring suggestions and validation
- TDD metrics tracking and optimization

---

### **Rule 5: Retrospective-Driven Improvement**
**HIGH**: Continuously improve processes through automated retrospectives and action implementation.

#### **Core Requirements**
- **Data-Driven Retrospectives**: Use metrics and data for improvement identification
- **Action Implementation**: Automatically implement improvement actions
- **Process Optimization**: Continuously optimize development processes
- **Learning Culture**: Learn from both successes and failures

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python
# CORRECT: Retrospective-driven improvement
def conduct_automated_retrospective(sprint_data: dict):
    """Conduct automated retrospective with action implementation."""
    # 1. Analyze sprint metrics and feedback
    # 2. Identify improvement opportunities
    # 3. Generate improvement actions
    # 4. Automatically implement actions
    # 5. Track improvement effectiveness
    pass

# INCORRECT: Manual retrospective without follow-up
def manual_retrospective(feedback: list):
    """Manual retrospective without automated improvement."""
    # This violates continuous improvement principles
    pass
```

#### **Improvement Automation**
- Automated retrospective data collection
- AI-powered improvement opportunity identification

---

### **Rule 6: Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Focus**
**HIGH**: Deliver minimal viable functionality that provides user value, then iterate based on feedback.

#### **Core Requirements**
- **Essential Features Only**: Implement only features essential for user value
- **Rapid Delivery**: Deliver working software in days, not weeks
- **Feedback-Driven Iteration**: Use feedback to guide next iterations
- **Value Optimization**: Optimize for user value, not feature completeness

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python
# CORRECT: MVP-focused development
def build_mvp(user_need: str, constraints: dict):
    """Build minimal viable product for user need."""
    # 1. Identify core value proposition
    # 2. Implement minimal essential features
    # 3. Deliver working software quickly
    # 4. Collect user feedback
    # 5. Iterate based on feedback
    pass

# INCORRECT: Feature-complete development
def build_complete_product(all_features: list):
    """Build product with all possible features."""
    # This violates MVP principles
    pass
```

#### **MVP Automation**
