## üöÄ **TIER 1: CRITICAL AGILE RULES (Always Apply)**

### **Rule 1: Customer Value & Working Software Priority** 
**MANIFESTO PRINCIPLE**: "Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."
**CRITICAL**: All development must prioritize customer value delivery and working software over documentation or process.

#### **Core Requirements** (Manifesto-Aligned)
- **Customer Value First**: Every task must deliver measurable customer value
- **Working Software Priority**: Focus on functional, testable software over documentation  
- **Early & Continuous Delivery**: Deploy working increments frequently (daily preferred)
- **User Story Completion**: Complete entire user stories that deliver customer value
- **Value-Based Prioritization**: Prioritize features by customer impact, not technical convenience

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python
# CORRECT: Sprint-focused development
def implement_user_story(story_id: str, sprint_goal: str):
    """Implement complete user story aligned with sprint goal."""
    # 1. Validate story aligns with sprint goal
    # 2. Implement minimum viable functionality
    # 3. Ensure story meets definition of done
    # 4. Deliver working software increment
    pass

# INCORRECT: Task-focused development ignoring sprint goals
def implement_technical_task(task_id: str):
    """Implement isolated technical task."""
    # This violates sprint-focused development
    pass
```

#### **Agile Automation**
- Automatic sprint goal validation for all tasks
- Working software validation before task completion
- Sprint boundary enforcement through automated checks
- User story completion tracking and validation

---

### **Rule 2: Embrace Change & Adaptation**
**MANIFESTO PRINCIPLE**: "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."
**CRITICAL**: All processes must be designed to embrace and adapt to change rapidly.

#### **Core Requirements**
- **Immediate Integration**: Code integrates within minutes of commit
- **Automated Testing**: 100% automated testing with no manual intervention
- **Deployment Readiness**: Every commit is potentially deployable
- **Rapid Feedback**: Feedback loops under 10 minutes

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python
# CORRECT: CI/CD-ready development
def develop_feature(feature_spec: dict):
    """Develop feature with full CI/CD integration."""
    # 1. Write tests first (TDD)
    # 2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
    # 3. Automated integration testing
    # 4. Automated deployment validation
    pass

# INCORRECT: Manual integration development
def develop_feature_manual(feature_spec: dict):

- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Regular stakeholder demos and feedback collection
- **Value Delivery**: Measure and optimize for user value, not technical metrics
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust plans based on feedback and changing requirements

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
```python

def implement_user_story(story: UserStory):
    """Implement user story with customer value focus."""
    # 1. Validate user value and acceptance criteria
    # 2. Implement user-facing functionality first
    # 3. Collect stakeholder feedback early
    # 4. Adapt based on feedback
    pass

# INCORRECT: Technology-centric development
def implement_technical_feature(tech_spec: dict):
    """Implement technology feature without user context."""
    # This violates customer collaboration principles
