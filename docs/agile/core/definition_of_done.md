# Definition of Done - AI-Dev-Agent System

## üéØ **Purpose**

The Definition of Done (DoD) establishes clear, measurable criteria that must be met before any work item can be considered complete. This ensures consistent quality, reduces technical debt, and enables predictable delivery.

## ‚úÖ **UNIVERSAL DEFINITION OF DONE**

All work items (User Stories, Tasks, Bugs, Spikes) must meet these criteria before being marked as "Done":

### **1. Functionality Complete**
- [ ] **All acceptance criteria met**: Every acceptance criterion is implemented and validated
- [ ] **User story value delivered**: The intended user value is demonstrably delivered
- [ ] **Edge cases handled**: Common edge cases and error conditions are properly handled
- [ ] **Integration complete**: Feature integrates properly with existing system components

### **2. Quality Assurance**
- [ ] **All tests pass**: 100% of automated tests pass (unit, integration, system)
- [ ] **Code coverage maintained**: Test coverage remains at or above 90% for core components
- [ ] **Performance validated**: Performance meets or exceeds established benchmarks
- [ ] **Security validated**: Security implications assessed and mitigated

### **3. Code Quality Standards**
- [ ] **Code review completed**: Code reviewed and approved by at least one team member
- [ ] **Coding standards followed**: Code adheres to established style guides and conventions
- [ ] **Refactoring complete**: Code is clean, maintainable, and follows DRY principles

    def __init__(self):
        self.code_quality_checker = CodeQualityChecker()
        self.test_runner = TestRunner()
        self.security_scanner = SecurityScanner()
        self.performance_tester = PerformanceTester()
    
    def validate_work_item(self, work_item: WorkItem) -> DoD_Result:
        """Validate work item against Definition of Done criteria."""
        results = {
            'functionality': self._validate_functionality(work_item),

        return DoD_Result(
            passed=all(results.values()),
            details=results,
            recommendations=self._generate_recommendations(results)
        )
    
    def _validate_functionality(self, work_item: WorkItem) -> bool:
        """Validate functionality criteria."""
        return all([
            self._check_acceptance_criteria(work_item),
            self._check_user_value_delivery(work_item),
            self._check_edge_cases(work_item),
            self._check_integration(work_item)
        ])
    
    def _validate_quality(self, work_item: WorkItem) -> bool:
        """Validate quality criteria."""
        test_results = self.test_runner.run_all_tests(work_item)
        coverage = self.test_runner.get_coverage(work_item)
        performance = self.performance_tester.validate(work_item)
        security = self.security_scanner.scan(work_item)
        
        return all([
            test_results.success_rate == 100,
            coverage >= 90,
            performance.meets_requirements(),
            security.no_critical_issues()
