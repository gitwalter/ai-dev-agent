    complexity, and determine optimal @keyword sequence composition.
    """
    
    def analyze_task(self, task_description: str) -> TaskAnalysis:
        """
        Analyze task and extract structured information.
        
        Returns:
            TaskAnalysis with type, complexity, entities, and requirements
        """
        
    def determine_required_contexts(self, analysis: TaskAnalysis) -> List[str]:
        """
        Determine which @keyword contexts are needed for task completion.
        
        Returns:
            List of required context names (e.g., ['AGILE', 'CODE', 'TEST'])
        """
        
    def assess_complexity(self, task_description: str) -> ComplexityLevel:

**Purpose**: Compose optimal sequences of @keyword contexts
**Location**: `workflow/composition/sequence_composer.py`

```python
class SequenceComposer:
    """
    Intelligently composes optimal sequences of @keyword contexts
    based on task analysis, dependencies, and proven patterns.
    """
    
    def compose_sequence(self, required_contexts: List[str], 
                        task_analysis: TaskAnalysis) -> WorkflowSequence:
        """

```python
class ContextOrchestrator:
    """
    Manages execution of workflows across multiple @keyword contexts
    with state management, result propagation, and error handling.
    """
    
    def execute_workflow(self, sequence: WorkflowSequence) -> WorkflowResult:
