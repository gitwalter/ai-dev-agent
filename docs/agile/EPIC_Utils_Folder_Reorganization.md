# Epic: Utils Folder Structure Reorganization

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: UTILS-001  
**Epic Title**: Reorganize Utils Folder Structure for Better Maintainability  
**Epic Type**: Technical Improvement  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 Sprint(s)  
**Target Completion**: Current Sprint (after all tests pass)  

## Problem Statement

The current utils folder structure has grown organically and contains a mix of organized subdirectories and loose root-level files. This creates several issues:

1. **Inconsistent Organization**: Some utilities are organized into logical subdirectories while others remain at the root level
2. **Import Path Confusion**: Mixed import patterns make it unclear where utilities should be located
3. **Scalability Issues**: As the project grows, finding and maintaining utilities becomes increasingly difficult
4. **Developer Experience**: New team members struggle to understand the utility organization structure

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Structure
```
utils/
├── __init__.py
├── README.md
├── collaboration/          # Empty subdirectory
├── core/                   # Contains: logging_config.py
├── integration/            # Empty subdirectory  
├── maintenance/            # Empty subdirectory
├── memory/                 # Empty subdirectory
├── parsing/                # Empty subdirectory
├── prompt_management/      # Empty subdirectory
├── quality/                # Empty subdirectory
├── check_all_code_generator_prompts.py  # Root level
├── file_manager.py                      # Root level
├── health_dashboard.py                  # Root level
├── helpers.py                           # Root level
├── logging_config.py                    # Root level (duplicate)
├── structured_outputs.py               # Root level
└── system_health_monitor.py             # Root level
```

### Import Dependencies
- **52 import statements** across the codebase reference utils modules
- **Mixed import patterns**: Some use organized paths (`utils.core.helpers`) while others use root-level paths (`utils.structured_outputs`)
- **Missing files**: Some imports reference files that may not exist or need to be created

## Goal State Vision

## User Stories

### Story 1: Import Path Consistency
**As a** developer  
**I want** consistent import paths for all utilities  
**So that** I can easily understand and remember where to find functionality  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All utilities use organized subdirectory import paths
- No utilities remain at the root level (except __init__.py and README.md)
- Import patterns are consistent across the codebase

### Story 2: Logical Organization
