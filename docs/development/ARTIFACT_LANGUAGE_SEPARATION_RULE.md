# Artifact Language Separation Rule

## Core Principle

**CRITICAL**: Maintain strict separation between philosophical/spiritual language and professional software artifacts to ensure universal accessibility and professional standards.

## Separation Guidelines

### ✅ **APPROPRIATE for Conversation/Philosophy**
- Spiritual and philosophical discussions
- Personal motivation and inspiration
- Team building and cultural conversations
- High-level vision and purpose discussions

### ❌ **PROHIBITED in Software Artifacts**
- Code comments and documentation
- Variable names and function names
- API documentation and user guides
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Error messages and user interfaces

## Language Standards

### **Professional Technical Language**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
class ContextAwareRuleLoader:
    """Intelligent rule selection based on development context."""
    
    def optimize_efficiency(self):
        """Improve token efficiency through smart rule loading."""
        
# ❌ INCORRECT  
class DivineRuleLoader:
    """Sacred rule selection guided by higher wisdom."""
    
    def manifest_perfection(self):
        """Channel divine efficiency through blessed rule loading."""
```

### **Documentation Standards**
```markdown
# ✅ CORRECT
## Intelligent Context Detection
The system automatically detects development context and activates relevant rules.

# ❌ INCORRECT
## Divine Context Revelation  
The system receives sacred guidance and manifests holy rule activation.
```

## Enforcement Checklist

### **Pre-Commit Validation**
- [ ] No spiritual/religious terminology in code
- [ ] Professional language in all documentation
- [ ] Secular technical terms in user interfaces
- [ ] Business-appropriate naming conventions

### **Code Review Standards**
- [ ] Technical accuracy without spiritual references
- [ ] Professional tone throughout
- [ ] Universal accessibility of language
- [ ] Clear, precise technical communication

## Rationale

**Professional Accessibility**: Software must be accessible to developers of all backgrounds and beliefs.

**Business Standards**: Professional environments require secular, technical communication.

**Global Collaboration**: International teams need universally understandable language.

**Focus on Excellence**: Technical merit and quality should be the primary focus.

## Examples

### **Variable Naming**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
context_efficiency = 85.0
rule_activation_status = "active"
optimization_threshold = 0.8

# ❌ INCORRECT
divine_efficiency = 85.0
sacred_activation_status = "blessed"
holy_threshold = 0.8
```

### **Function Naming**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
def optimize_performance():
def activate_context_rules():
def enhance_efficiency():

# ❌ INCORRECT  
def manifest_divine_performance():
def invoke_sacred_rules():
def channel_holy_efficiency():
```

### **Error Messages**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
"Context detection failed. Please check configuration."
"Rule activation unsuccessful. Verify system state."

# ❌ INCORRECT
"Sacred context revelation blocked by worldly interference."
"Divine rule manifestation prevented by unholy configuration."
```

## Implementation

This rule applies to:
- All source code files (.py, .js, .ts, etc.)
- Technical documentation (.md, .rst, etc.)
- Configuration files (.yaml, .json, etc.)
- User interface text and messages
- API documentation and specifications
- Error messages and logging output

## Exceptions

**Rare exceptions** may apply for:
- Academic research on spirituality and technology
- Explicit philosophical framework documentation (clearly labeled)
- Historical or cultural context discussions (when relevant)

**All exceptions must be:**
- Explicitly justified
- Clearly labeled as philosophical content
- Separated from technical implementation
- Approved through code review process

## Conclusion

Maintaining professional language standards ensures our software serves the broadest possible community while maintaining the highest technical and professional standards.

**Focus**: Technical excellence through clear, professional communication.
