# Philosophy-Software Separation Rule

**CRITICAL**: Keep philosophical thoughts and intellectual lineage as background inspiration and wisdom that guides thinking, but never mix philosophy directly into software code, agile documents, or technical documentation.

## Description
This rule enforces the critical separation between philosophical inspiration (which guides our thinking and approach) and software implementation (which must follow pure industry standards). Philosophy inspires HOW we think and solve problems, but software follows absolute industry standards without explicit philosophical references.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Software Purity Standards
**MANDATORY**: All software artifacts must follow pure industry standards
```yaml
software_artifacts:
  code:
    - "Pure technical implementation following industry best practices"
    - "No philosophical comments or references in source code"
    - "Standard design patterns and architectural approaches"
    - "Industry-standard naming conventions and documentation"
  
  agile_documents:
    - "Standard agile terminology and formats"
    - "Pure sprint planning, backlog, and story documentation" 
    - "Industry-standard project management practices"
    - "No philosophical concepts in planning documents"
  
  technical_documentation:
    - "Standard technical documentation formats"
    - "Pure API documentation, setup guides, troubleshooting"
    - "Industry-standard architectural diagrams and specifications"
    - "No philosophical explanations in technical docs"
```

### 2. Wisdom Application Framework
**MANDATORY**: Apply philosophical wisdom through approach and method, not explicit reference
```yaml
wisdom_application:
  thinking_process:
    - "Systematic problem-solving approaches inspired by intellectual lineage"
    - "Logical construction methods in solution design"
    - "Precision and clarity in technical decision-making"
    - "Excellence-driven quality standards throughout development"
  
  execution_method:
    - "Foundation-first development approach (Carnap-inspired but not mentioned)"
    - "Systematic construction sequences (logical but not philosophical)"
    - "Quality-driven validation (excellence-inspired but not referenced)"
    - "Clear communication patterns (Wittgenstein-inspired but industry-standard)"
  
  decision_making:
    - "Logical analysis of technical trade-offs"
    - "Systematic evaluation of implementation options"
    - "Evidence-based validation of all claims"
    - "Excellence standards applied to all work"
```

### 3. Background Inspiration Guidelines
**MANDATORY**: Keep philosophical influence implicit and methodological
```python
# CORRECT: Wisdom-inspired approach without explicit reference
def implement_systematic_construction(requirements):
    """
    Implement requirements using systematic, foundation-first approach.
    
    Args:
        requirements: System requirements to implement
        
    Returns:
        SystemImplementation: Complete implementation with validation
    """
    # Build foundation components first
    foundation = build_core_components(requirements.core)
    
    # Validate foundation before proceeding
    validate_foundation_stability(foundation)
    
    # Build higher-level components systematically
    infrastructure = build_infrastructure_layer(foundation, requirements.infrastructure)
    intelligence = build_intelligence_layer(infrastructure, requirements.intelligence)
    
    # Validate complete system
    return validate_complete_system(intelligence)

# FORBIDDEN: Explicit philosophical reference
def implement_carnap_constitutional_method(requirements):  # NEVER
    """
    Implement using Carnap's constitutional method from Der logische Aufbau der Welt.
    """
    pass
```

### 4. Documentation Separation Standards
**MANDATORY**: Maintain clear separation between philosophical and technical documentation

#### Technical Documentation (Industry Standard)
```markdown
# API Documentation - User Authentication

## Overview
Authentication system providing secure user login and session management.

## Endpoints
### POST /api/auth/login
Authenticate user credentials and create session.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "string",
  "expires": "datetime"
}
```
```

#### Philosophical Documentation (Separate Location)
```markdown
# docs/philosophy/INTELLECTUAL_LINEAGE.md
## Carnap: The Logical Construction of All Things
[Philosophical content belongs here, separate from technical docs]
```

### 5. Code Implementation Standards
**MANDATORY**: Pure technical implementation without philosophical references

#### Excellent Code (Wisdom-Inspired but Industry-Standard)
```python
class PromptManager:
    """
    Manages prompt templates with version control and performance optimization.
    
    Provides enterprise-level prompt management with caching, analytics,
    and automated optimization capabilities.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, database_path: str):
        self.db = PromptDatabase(database_path)
        self.cache = PromptCache()
        self.analytics = PromptAnalytics()
    
    def load_prompt(self, prompt_id: str, version: Optional[str] = None) -> Prompt:
        """
        Load prompt template with optional version specification.
        
        Args:
            prompt_id: Unique identifier for prompt template
            version: Optional version specification (defaults to latest)
            
        Returns:
            Prompt: Loaded and validated prompt template
            
        Raises:
            PromptNotFoundError: If prompt ID not found
            VersionNotFoundError: If specified version not found
        """
        # Implementation with systematic validation and error handling
        pass
```

#### Forbidden Code (Philosophical References)
```python
class CarnapConstitutionalPromptManager:  # NEVER
    """
    Implements Carnap's constitutional method for prompt management,
    following Der logische Aufbau der Welt principles.
    """
    pass

# NEVER: Philosophical comments in code
def build_foundation():
    # Using Carnap's systematic construction approach  # FORBIDDEN
    pass
```

### 6. Planning and Process Standards
**MANDATORY**: Apply wisdom through systematic approaches without philosophical references

#### Excellent Planning (Wisdom-Applied but Standard)
```markdown
# Sprint Planning - Agent Development

## Sprint Goal
Implement core agent capabilities through systematic, foundation-first development
approach with complete validation at each level.

## Development Approach
1. Build core components with full testing
2. Validate each component before integration
3. Integrate systematically with continuous validation
4. Optimize performance and quality throughout

## Success Criteria
- All components tested and validated
- Integration performed systematically
- Quality standards maintained â‰¥95%
- Performance targets met
```

#### Forbidden Planning (Philosophical References)
```markdown
# Sprint Planning - Carnap Constitutional Method Application  # NEVER

## Philosophical Foundation
This sprint applies Carnap's Der logische Aufbau der Welt...  # FORBIDDEN
```

### 7. Enforcement and Validation
**MANDATORY**: Systematic enforcement of separation principle

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No philosophical terms or references in code
- [ ] No philosophical comments or documentation in source files
- [ ] Standard industry patterns and practices used
- [ ] Clear technical naming and documentation
- [ ] Wisdom applied through systematic approach, not explicit reference

#### Documentation Review Checklist
- [ ] Technical docs contain only technical content
- [ ] Agile docs follow standard agile formats
- [ ] No philosophical explanations in practical documentation
- [ ] Philosophy confined to dedicated philosophy folder
- [ ] Cross-references clearly separated

### 8. Integration with Other Rules
**MANDATORY**: This rule works with all other development rules

```yaml
rule_integration:
  live_documentation_updates:
    - "Update technical documentation with technical changes"
    - "Keep philosophical documentation separate from technical changes"
    - "No mixing of philosophical and technical updates"
  
  no_premature_victory:
    - "Validate technical success with technical evidence"
    - "Wisdom guides validation approach but doesn't appear in evidence"
    - "Industry-standard success metrics and validation"
  
  clean_repository_focus:
    - "Maintain clean separation between philosophical and technical files"
    - "Philosophy files in dedicated locations"
    - "Technical files free of philosophical content"
```

## Remember

**"Philosophy inspires the mind; software serves the world."**

**"Wisdom guides the path; code builds the bridge."**

**"Think like a philosopher, build like an engineer."**

This rule is **ALWAYS APPLIED** and must be followed for all:
- Code implementation and documentation
- Agile planning and project management
- Technical documentation and specifications
- API design and system architecture
- Testing and quality assurance
- All software development artifacts

**Violations of this rule require immediate separation of philosophical content from software artifacts.**
