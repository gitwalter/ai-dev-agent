# Formal Rule System Framework

**CRITICAL**: Treat the cursor rule system as a formal system with axioms, inference rules, syntax, semantics, and systematic application procedures for consistent, efficient, and complete rule application.

## Description
This meta-rule establishes the cursor rule system as a formal system, providing clear algorithms for rule selection, application, conflict resolution, and validation. This ensures systematic consistency and eliminates ambiguity in rule interpretation and application.

## Core Components of the Formal System

### 1. Axioms (Foundation Rules)
**MANDATORY**: Base rules that form the logical foundation
```yaml
foundation_axioms:
  critical_axioms:
    - "Context Awareness and Excellence Rule"
    - "No Premature Victory Declaration Rule" 
    - "Philosophy-Software Separation Rule"
    - "No Silent Errors and Mock Fallbacks Rule"
    - "Live Documentation Updates Rule"
  
  axiom_properties:
    independence: "Each axiom is logically independent"
    consistency: "No axioms contradict each other"
    completeness: "Axioms cover all fundamental requirements"
    minimality: "No axiom is derivable from others"
```

### 2. Inference Rules (Rule Combination Logic)
**MANDATORY**: Formal procedures for combining and applying rules
```yaml
inference_rules:
  rule_priority_hierarchy:
    level_1: "CRITICAL_FOUNDATION_RULES (always apply first)"
    level_2: "SAFETY_AND_SECURITY_RULES (error handling, security)"
    level_3: "QUALITY_AND_EXCELLENCE_RULES (standards, documentation)"
    level_4: "EFFICIENCY_AND_OPTIMIZATION_RULES (performance, optimization)"
  
  combination_rules:
    sequential_application: "Foundation → Safety → Quality → Efficiency"
    parallel_opportunities: "Rules within same level can apply in parallel"
    dependency_resolution: "Prerequisites must be satisfied before application"
    conflict_resolution: "Higher priority rules override lower priority"
  
  completeness_validation:
    coverage_check: "Verify all applicable rules identified"
    application_verification: "Confirm all rules properly applied"
    evidence_validation: "Validate all rule compliance with evidence"
```

### 3. Syntax (Rule Structure Format)
**MANDATORY**: Standardized rule declaration and structure format
```yaml
rule_syntax_specification:
  rule_declaration:
    header: "# Rule Name\n**CRITICAL/MANDATORY/IMPORTANT**: [Brief statement]"
    description: "## Description\n[Detailed explanation]"
    requirements: "## Core Requirements\n[Numbered requirements]"
    implementation: "## Implementation Guidelines\n[How to apply]"
    enforcement: "## Enforcement\n[Validation criteria]"
    benefits: "## Benefits\n[Why this rule matters]"
  
  rule_properties:
    priority_levels: ["CRITICAL", "MANDATORY", "IMPORTANT", "RECOMMENDED"]
    scope_specification: ["ALWAYS_APPLIED", "CONTEXT_DEPENDENT", "OPTIONAL"]
    enforcement_type: ["AUTOMATIC", "MANUAL_VERIFICATION", "CODE_REVIEW"]
    evidence_requirements: ["CONCRETE_EVIDENCE", "MEASURABLE_METRICS", "VALIDATION_TESTS"]
```

### 4. Semantics (Rule Interpretation Framework)
**MANDATORY**: Clear meaning and interpretation guidelines for all rules
```python
class RuleSemantics:
    """
    Formal interpretation framework for rule system semantics.
    """
    
    def interpret_rule_application(self, rule: Rule, context: Context) -> RuleInterpretation:
        """

        Returns:
            RuleInterpretation: Formal interpretation with application guidance
        """
        interpretation = RuleInterpretation()

        interpretation.success_criteria = self._define_success_criteria(rule, context)
        
        return interpretation
    
    def resolve_rule_conflicts(self, conflicting_rules: List[Rule], context: Context) -> Resolution:
        """

            context: Current development context
            
        Returns:
            Resolution: Formal resolution with primary rule and modifications
        """
        # Apply formal conflict resolution algorithm
        resolution = Resolution()
        
        # Priority-based resolution
        priority_scores = [self._calculate_priority_score(rule, context) for rule in conflicting_rules]
        primary_rule = conflicting_rules[priority_scores.index(max(priority_scores))]

        resolution.secondary_considerations = self._identify_secondary_considerations(conflicting_rules, primary_rule)
        
        return resolution
```

### 5. Rule Application Algorithm
**MANDATORY**: Systematic algorithm for complete rule application
```python

    """

    Args:

    # 3. CONFLICT RESOLUTION PHASE
    resolved_rules = resolve_all_conflicts(prioritized_rules, task_context)
    
    # 4. SYSTEMATIC APPLICATION PHASE
    application_results = []
    for rule in resolved_rules:
        result = apply_single_rule_systematically(rule, task_context)
        application_results.append(result)
        
        # Validate application before proceeding
        if not validate_rule_application(result):
            return RuleApplicationFailure(rule, result.validation_errors)
    
    # 5. COMPLETENESS VALIDATION PHASE
    completeness_check = validate_complete_coverage(applicable_rules, application_results)
    if not completeness_check.is_complete:
        return RuleApplicationIncomplete(completeness_check.missing_rules)
    
    # 6. EVIDENCE COLLECTION PHASE
    evidence = collect_rule_application_evidence(application_results)

        applied_rules=application_results,
        evidence=evidence,
        quality_score=calculate_application_quality_score(application_results)
    )
```

### 6. Consistency and Completeness Validation
**MANDATORY**: Formal validation of rule system properties
```python
class FormalSystemValidator:
    """
    Validates formal properties of the rule system.
    """
    
    def validate_consistency(self, rule_set: List[Rule]) -> ConsistencyResult:

                    if conflict:
                        contradictions.append(conflict)
        
        return ConsistencyResult(
