# Carnap Constitutional Development Rule

**CRITICAL**: Always apply Rudolf Carnap's constitutional method from "Der logische Aufbau der Welt" to all development work. Every complex system must be constructed systematically from basic, verified elements through logical constitutional definitions.

## Description

This rule establishes Carnap's constitutional method as the mandatory approach for all development work. Following Carnap's systematic construction of all knowledge from elementary experiences, we construct all software systems through constitutional definitions where higher-level concepts are precisely defined in terms of lower-level, empirically verifiable elements.

## Core Carnapian Principles

### **1. Constitutional Construction Method**
**MANDATORY**: All complex systems must be built through constitutional construction

```yaml
constitutional_construction_requirements:
  systematic_reduction:
    - "Every complex concept must be reducible to more basic constituent concepts"
    - "Continue reduction until reaching empirically verifiable elementary operations"
    - "Document the complete reduction chain for all complex systems"
    - "Validate logical consistency at every reduction step"
  
  constitutional_definitions:
    - "Define every higher-level concept precisely in terms of lower-level concepts"
    - "Ensure all definitions are logically consistent and non-circular"
    - "Provide empirical verification methods for all definitions"
    - "Create complete constitutional hierarchy from elementary to complex"
  
  systematic_construction:
    - "Build complex systems by following constitutional definitions exactly"
    - "Never skip construction levels or take logical shortcuts"
    - "Validate each construction step through empirical testing"
    - "Ensure construction completeness before proceeding to next level"
```

### **2. Four-Level Construction Hierarchy**
**MANDATORY**: Apply Carnap's four-level construction to all development

```python
class CarnapianConstructionLevels:
    """
    Implement Carnap's four-level construction hierarchy for all development.

### **9. Implementation Guidelines**

#### **Before Starting Any Development Work**
**MANDATORY**: Always follow this Carnapian preparation sequence

```yaml
carnapian_development_preparation:
  1_problem_analysis:
    - "Apply quasi-analysis to understand problem structure"
    - "Identify similarity classes and quality dimensions"
    - "Decompose problem to basic constitutional elements"
    
  2_constitutional_planning:
    - "Create constitutional definitions for all target concepts"
    - "Plan construction sequence from elementary to complex"
    - "Define verification methods for each construction level"
    
  3_basic_element_verification:
    - "Verify all required basic elements are available and functional"
    - "Test basic elements independently before construction"
    - "Create protocol sentences for basic element validation"
    
  4_construction_execution:
    - "Build systematically level by level"
    - "Validate each level through protocol sentences"
    - "Never skip levels or take logical shortcuts"
    
  5_empirical_validation:
    - "Test complete construction through operational verification"
    - "Measure performance and quality metrics"
    - "Validate with real-world usage scenarios"
```

#### **During Development Work**
**MANDATORY**: Maintain constitutional construction discipline

```yaml
construction_discipline:
  level_completion_requirements:
    - "Complete current level fully before starting next level"
    - "Validate constitutional definitions for current level"
    - "Generate and verify protocol sentences for level"
    - "Document construction decisions and rationale"
  
  integration_checkpoints:
    - "Test integration points as they are created"
    - "Validate system unity after each integration"
    - "Ensure no constitutional violations introduced"
    - "Maintain empirical verifiability throughout"
  
  quality_maintenance:
    - "Apply constitutional definitions consistently"
    - "Maintain logical consistency across all components"
    - "Ensure empirical grounding for all claims"
    - "Document constitutional relationships clearly"
```

### **10. Enforcement Mechanisms**

#### **Code Review Requirements**
**MANDATORY**: All code reviews must validate constitutional construction

```yaml
constitutional_code_review:
  required_checks:
    - "Constitutional definition provided for all complex concepts"
    - "Reduction to basic elements documented and validated"
    - "Protocol sentences generated for all functionality claims"
    - "Empirical verification methods provided for all features"
    - "Construction level appropriate for component complexity"
    - "Logical consistency maintained across system"
  
  review_questions:
    - "What basic elements does this component reduce to?"
    - "How is this concept constitutionally defined?"
    - "What protocol sentences verify this functionality?"
    - "How is this empirically validated?"
    - "Does this maintain system unity and coherence?"
```

#### **Testing Requirements**
**MANDATORY**: All testing must follow constitutional method

```python
def test_constitutionally(component: Component) -> ConstitutionalTestResult:
    """
    Test component following Carnap's constitutional method.
    
    Args:
        component: Component to test
        
    Returns:
        Constitutional test result with verification
    """
    test_results = []
    
    # Test basic elements first
    basic_elements = component.get_basic_elements()
    for element in basic_elements:
        element_test = test_basic_element(element)
        test_results.append(element_test)
    
    # Test constitutional construction
    construction_test = test_constitutional_construction(component)
    test_results.append(construction_test)
    
    # Test empirical verification
    empirical_test = test_empirical_verification(component)
    test_results.append(empirical_test)
    
    # Validate protocol sentences
    protocol_validation = validate_component_protocols(component)
    test_results.append(protocol_validation)
    
    return ConstitutionalTestResult(
        component=component,
        test_results=test_results,
        constitutional_valid=all(test.passed for test in test_results),
        construction_complete=construction_test.construction_complete,
        empirically_verified=empirical_test.verification_successful
    )
```
