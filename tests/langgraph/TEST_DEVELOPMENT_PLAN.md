# Test-Driven Development Plan for LangGraph Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines our test-driven approach to building a robust LangGraph-based agent system using established libraries and best practices.

## Research Findings

### Established Libraries for Agent Development

1. **LangChain + LangGraph + LangSmith** (Primary Choice)
   - **LangGraph**: Multi-agent workflows with state management
   - **LangChain**: LLM integration, prompt management, output parsing
   - **LangSmith**: Observability, debugging, prompt optimization
   - **Benefits**: 80% less custom code, battle-tested, comprehensive features

2. **AutoGen** (Secondary for Human-in-the-Loop)
   - Multi-agent conversations
   - Built-in human interaction
   - Good for approval workflows

3. **CrewAI** (Alternative)
   - Role-based agent teams
   - Task delegation
   - Less mature than LangChain ecosystem

    architecture: Dict[str, Any]
    code_files: Dict[str, Any]
    tests: Dict[str, Any]
    documentation: Dict[str, Any]
    agent_outputs: Dict[str, Any]
    errors: List[str]
    warnings: List[str]
    current_step: str
    execution_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]

# 2. Agent Node Factory
class AgentNodeFactory:
    def create_requirements_node(self, llm) -> Callable
    def create_architecture_node(self, llm) -> Callable
    def create_code_generator_node(self, llm) -> Callable
    # ... more agents

# 3. Workflow Manager
class LangGraphWorkflowManager:
    def __init__(self, llm_config: Dict[str, Any])
    def create_workflow(self) -> StateGraph
    async def execute_workflow(self, initial_state: Dict) -> Dict
    def add_error_handling(self, workflow: StateGraph) -> StateGraph
```

## Test Implementation Strategy

### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with basic LangGraph workflow creation
- Test individual components in isolation
- Use mocks for external dependencies

### 2. Build Incrementally
- Add one agent at a time
- Test agent integration before moving to next
- Validate state management at each step

### 3. Comprehensive Validation
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Validate structured outputs against Pydantic models
- Test error handling and recovery

### 4. Performance and Reliability
- Test with realistic data sizes
- Validate memory usage and cleanup
- Test concurrent execution scenarios

## Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for core components
- **Integration Tests**: All agent interactions
- **System Tests**: Complete workflow scenarios
- **Error Handling**: All failure modes

- **Reliability**: Error recovery and graceful degradation
- **Maintainability**: Clean, documented, testable code

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Development
- Keep existing system running
- Develop new LangGraph system alongside
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
- Migrate one agent at a time
- Validate each migration with tests
- Rollback capability for each phase

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- Complete system migration
- Performance validation
- Documentation and training

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for all components

- **Maintainability**: <100 lines of custom code per agent

### Business Metrics
- **Development Speed**: 80% reduction in custom code
- **Debugging Time**: 90% reduction with LangSmith
- **Feature Delivery**: 3x faster with established patterns
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix current test failures and establish basic workflow
2. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 tests and basic implementation
3. **Week 2**: Implement Phase 2 agent integration tests
4. **Week 3**: Complete Phase 3 workflow integration and advanced features

This test-driven approach ensures we build a robust, maintainable, and reliable agent system using established best practices and libraries.
