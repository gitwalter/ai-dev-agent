AI-Dev-Agent Demo Runner - One-Click Experience
===============================================

Run the complete AI-Dev-Agent Working Demo System with a single command.

Usage:
    python run_demo.py

Note: Use your local Python/Anaconda installation. When we containerize,
this will be completely environment-agnostic.

This will demonstrate:
🔧 Effortless agent coordination patterns
📊 Evidence-based AI decision-making  
⚡ Strategic coordination for efficient development
🤝 Clean communication protocols
🌟 Complete system integration and modularity

Built for Developer Delight and Universal Service
Created: 2024 - For Global Developer Community
