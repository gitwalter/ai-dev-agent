## Expected Output

The Requirements Analyst will generate:

1. **Functional Requirements**: Specific, measurable features the system must have
2. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability requirements
3. **User Stories**: User-focused descriptions of functionality
4. **Technical Constraints**: Technology and architectural constraints
5. **Risks**: Identified project risks and concerns
6. **Complete Analysis**: Comprehensive requirements document

## How to Test in Studio

1. **Open Studio**: Navigate to `http://localhost:2024`
2. **Select Graph**: Click on "requirements_analyst" graph
3. **Create New Thread**: Click "New Thread" button
4. **Paste Input**: Copy one of the example JSON inputs above
5. **Run**: Click "Run" or "Invoke" button
6. **Watch Execution**: See the graph execute through stages:
   - `analyze_functional` - Analyzes functional requirements
   - `analyze_non_functional` - Analyzes non-functional requirements  
   - `generate_user_stories` - Creates user stories
   - `identify_constraints` - Identifies technical constraints
   - `assess_risks` - Assesses project risks
   - `finalize_analysis` - Combines all analysis
7. **View Output**: Check the final state for complete requirements analysis

## Troubleshooting

- **Graph not loading**: Check terminal for errors, ensure `langgraph dev` is running
- **TypedDict warnings**: Fixed by using `typing_extensions.TypedDict`
- **Metrics errors**: Fixed by initializing metrics dict before access
- **Unicode errors**: Emojis in logs may cause issues on Windows - these are cosmetic only

## Testing Tips

- Start with **Example 3** (minimal) for quickest test
- Use **Example 1** for comprehensive test
- Try variations: different budgets, timelines, feature sets
- Observe how agent adapts analysis to project complexity
