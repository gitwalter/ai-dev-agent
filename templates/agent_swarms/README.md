## Customization Guide

### Agent Role Customization

#### Adding New Roles
```yaml
new_agent_role:
  role: "Specific Role Description"
  language_layer: "appropriate_layer"
  linguistic_framework: "framework_type"
  specialization: "domain_expertise"
  responsibilities:
    - "primary_responsibility"
    - "secondary_responsibility"
  communication_style: "style_description"
  authority_level: "decision_scope"
  coordination_patterns: ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
```

#### Modifying Existing Roles
- **Responsibility Adjustment**: Add/remove responsibilities based on team needs
