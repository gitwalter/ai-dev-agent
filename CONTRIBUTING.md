## 📋 **Contribution Guidelines**

### **1. Development Principles**

#### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Write tests **before** implementing functionality
- Achieve >95% test coverage for all new code
- Include unit, integration, and system tests
- Use meaningful test names that describe scenarios

```python
def test_agent_handles_invalid_input_gracefully():
    """Test that agent provides helpful error message for invalid input."""
    agent = RequirementsAnalyst()
    result = agent.analyze("")
    assert result.success is False
    assert "provide more details" in result.message.lower()
```

#### **Clean Code Practices**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities
- Maximum function length: 50 lines (exceptions require justification)

```python
def extract_requirements_from_text(user_input: str) -> RequirementsAnalysis:
    """Extract structured requirements from user input text.
    
    Args:
        user_input: Raw text input from user describing project needs
        
    Returns:
        RequirementsAnalysis: Structured analysis with extracted requirements
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If input is empty or invalid format
    """
    if not user_input.strip():
        raise ValidationError("User input cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation with clear, focused logic
    return RequirementsAnalysis(...)
```

#### **Evidence-Based Validation**
- All features must have working demonstrations
- Performance claims must include benchmarks
- No theoretical features without practical implementation
- Document actual usage examples and outcomes

### **2. Code Quality Standards**

#### **Documentation Requirements**
- **Docstrings**: All public functions, classes, and modules
- **Type Hints**: Complete type annotations
- **README Files**: Each major component needs usage documentation
- **Examples**: Working code examples for all features
- **Architecture Docs**: System design documentation for complex components

#### **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error handling without silent failures
- Meaningful error messages for users
- Proper exception hierarchies
- Graceful degradation where possible
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

```python
class AgentProcessingError(Exception):
    """Raised when agent processing fails."""
    pass

def process_user_request(request: str) -> ProcessingResult:
    """Process user request with comprehensive error handling."""
    try:
        validated_request = validate_request(request)
        result = execute_processing(validated_request)
        return ProcessingResult.success(result)
    except ValidationError as e:
        logger.warning(f"Invalid request: {e}")
        return ProcessingResult.error(f"Request validation failed: {e}")
    except AgentProcessingError as e:
        logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}")
        return ProcessingResult.error(f"Unable to process request: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.critical(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return ProcessingResult.error("System error occurred")
```

#### **Security Considerations**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API key management (use Streamlit secrets)
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Security testing for all user-facing features

### **3. Testing Standards**

#### **Test Categories**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and workflows
- **System Tests**: End-to-end testing of complete features
- **Performance Tests**: Validate performance requirements
- **Security Tests**: Test security measures and vulnerability prevention

#### **Test Structure**
```python
class TestRequirementsAnalyst:
    """Comprehensive test suite for requirements analysis."""
    
    def test_extract_functional_requirements_from_simple_input(self):
        """Test extraction of functional requirements from simple user input."""
        # Given
        analyst = RequirementsAnalyst()
        user_input = "I need a web app for managing customer orders"
        
        # When
        result = analyst.analyze(user_input)
        
        # Then
        assert result.success is True
        assert len(result.functional_requirements) > 0
        assert any("customer" in req.lower() for req in result.functional_requirements)
        assert any("order" in req.lower() for req in result.functional_requirements)
    
    def test_handles_empty_input_gracefully(self):
        """Test graceful handling of empty input."""
        # Given, When, Then pattern for all tests
        ...
```

#### **Test Coverage Requirements**
- **Minimum**: 95% branch coverage for all new code
- **Documentation**: Document test scenarios and edge cases
- **Performance**: Include performance regression tests
- **Integration**: Test all external integrations and APIs
